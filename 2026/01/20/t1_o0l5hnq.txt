Staking pool like Everstake is more traditional, you send your ETH to their smart contract/validator, it's locked, you earn rewards.

Liquid staking, you send your ETH to a protocol, you are given an ETH token in return, like stETH - so your ETH is being staked, and you can play with your liquid token as well.

IMO, liquid staking has slightly higher risk associated.
