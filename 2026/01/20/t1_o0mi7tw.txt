The thing is that they point at crypto regarding quantum computing but they dont point to be concerned about all banking system which is not quantum computing proof and is a really old crap + to all the passwords and accounts you have online.

Its fine to be worried about stuff becoming quantum computing safe but for everything not just crypto. Thats why it is FUD because they only point the thing they want to "hurt".
