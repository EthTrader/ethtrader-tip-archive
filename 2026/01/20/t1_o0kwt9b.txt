Everstake.one and Ether.fi get my recommendations, they require you to take custody and get your Ethereum of your exchange, and then interact with DeFi.

This means you get approximately the organic stake reward rate, nor are you using a company like Celsius which does their own thing with lending.

However, if you want a reputable option that has zero lock up, you can lend on aave.com - it will be a lower APY, closer to 2%, but you can withdraw whenever you want.
