There are now several options for users to choose with staking services, and it's great to see those expand beyond LIDO and Rocketpool, which were the top options at some stage, beyond a CEX.

Evertsake and Ether.fi certainly get my recommendations for users looking to stake for their ease of use, and to help maintain a level of decentralization.
