Everstake was actually my first experience staking outside of a CEX.

I always avoided LIDO because of their dominance, and I wasn't quite comfortable with the liquid staking concept LIDO and Rocketpool had when I was first learning the ropes.

Everstakes simplicity of pooled staking was much more comfortable; and have been staking there for a few years now!
