He claimed Aerodrome did more volume than Uniswap, but you do bring up the interesting difference about Katana.

Sushi for trading and Morpho for lending, having the entire chains liquidity on just a couple of protocols...  It'll be interesting to see if trading actually becomes more efficient with deeper concentrated liquidity.

Wonder why Sushi.com got it over Uniswap or another popular dex though.
