\[YES\] I like the idea but I think "Shitpost" flair from psychological/marketing aspect is not the right name because some people can feel attacked, its not neutral and it does not clarify that it has no rewards.

I suggest "No Reward",  "No Donuts", "0x Rewards", "Unrewarded" or "No Payout" Flairs or something similar. They are clear, neutral, not offensive, auto explains and furthermore gives a hint that there are posts that are rewarded (soft Donut marketing).

Furthermore, the shitpost flair could make non usual users believe that they should downdoot the content reducing discussions and exposure.

One way or another I would vote yes but I encourage rethinking on the name of the flair.
