I still hold, and LP them.

The price has been suppressed by a whale so bought up several millions of them after the price crashed from the sunset.

But, they still have a large active team and tokenomics that will support some price swings when that sell wall gets eaten. Purely deflationary due to the fact no new minting occurs.

It makes an interesting case between DONUT and MOON, with ETH vs BTC comparison in from a tokenomics perspective xD

But it's a double edged sword, to pay for developments they will rely purely on sponsors, rather than having an inflationary nature with fresh emissions.

pro's and con's to each.
