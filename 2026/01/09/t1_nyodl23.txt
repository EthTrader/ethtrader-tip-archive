Aside from the fact its already been rather lucrative for providers; adding more incentives now when the top 5 providers are over 75% of the pool ownership would simply be giving the current top providers a growing portion of overall supply. I say this as one of the top providers.

Perhaps we can add more DONUT to three incentives later, but at this stage it wouldnt really be viable.

The funny thing is, the greater the liquidity, the more stable the price can become. When there is more DONUT in the pool it will take greater volume to actually cause price swings. This is that "liquidity depth" i have mentioned in previous posts.

Still. We continue on, its definitely not a requirement to provide liquidity, but those who want a CEX listing should consider it if they want it to help make it happen 😎
