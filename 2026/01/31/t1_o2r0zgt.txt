My average is good below $3k. The only real mistake, now I’d say, was not taking profits wen ETH hit its ATH. I guess sometimes the hype of prices going higher just freezes your hands wen you should actually suppose to hit the sell button. 

Anyway, no regrets if I see my some other cryptos blunders 🫠
