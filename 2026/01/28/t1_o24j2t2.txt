Topic filter is top 50.

The front page, I believe technically is top 25. (As per Old.Reddit) When sorting by 'Hot' the first 2 posts are pinned posts, and the next 23 are the top upvoted/age algorithm on the 'front page'.

New.Reddit and Reddit app, it's not as defined as they rely on a neverending scrolling page.

Perhaps we could adjust the rule to be defined by 48 hour periods instead, and potentially increased to 3, given how many less posts there are these days.
