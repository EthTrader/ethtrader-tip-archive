To be fair, Sushi don't indicate it very clearly anymore.

There used to be a little question mark which you could click to see the 'route' a trade was taking.

This is Uniswap for example

If I wanted to trade TAO for DONUT.

The most liquidity is in a TAO/USDC pair. and DONUT only pairs with ETH.

So while it seems like I'm swapping TAO for DONUT, the DEX is actually routing 3 transactions; TAO to USDC, USDC to ETH, ETH to DONUT.
