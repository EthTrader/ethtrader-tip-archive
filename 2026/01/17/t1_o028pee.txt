SushiSwap is well-known and widely used so not such risks. Yes Impermanent loss is a valid risk, if the price of DONUT changes a lot compared to ETH (because it paired with ETH).

More info about IL you can get by more technically sound guy DBRiMatt. But what I personally experienced you earn rather than loss.
