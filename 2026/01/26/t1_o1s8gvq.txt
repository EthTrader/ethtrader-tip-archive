I would still prefer physical art. I don't see the interest in NFT's for the 'art'. You have to use the interenet and load up your laptop/phone or whatever to even look at it.


I've seen some people that have physical copies of NFT's on the wall in their homes. They even prefer the physical art themselves.


I get the use cases for ownership and whatnot but other than that people are mainly using them to try and make money and that's it.
