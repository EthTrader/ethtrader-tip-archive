Valid question.

But, ultimately,  just another way for a company to make money.

Ledger wouldn't care if Bitcoin or Ethereum go up in price, they just rely on people using cold storage due to the nature of DeFi hacks/exploits and exchanges going bust, and humans making mistakes. 

I'd be willing to bet on those things continuing to happen, that's for sure! xD
