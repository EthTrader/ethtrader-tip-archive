Automatizing regulatory compliance is mandatory and this must be done on another place where governments are not directly involved in terms of investing. The problem is that governments are not willing to effectively invest money into those kind of things.

Just looking any of a government site or whatever you will see that they are obsolete and nowadays, updating that requires doing it from zero and that cost a lot of money
