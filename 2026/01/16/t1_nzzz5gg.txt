There is only a DONUT/ETH trading pair, so. It may or may not be cheaper to to the ETH to USD conversion on his Exchange

Even though it may be an option to go to USDT on Sushi.com, the "route" it will take will incur 2 trading fees. To ETH and then to USDT

Being non US. I would need to still convert USDT to fiat to off ramp, so it would be cheaper for me to do that 2nd trade on my CEX.

Prob only a few cents difference though 😆
