It's an interesting concept betting only on wildly irrational markets. I've got to say it has got me interested and I've been on polymarket for the first time this morning.


The problem is the odds are incredibly short so without a large amount of capital is it really worth the risk? If you keep rolling over time it will compound I guess but knowing my luck I'll end up losing on some crazy pick.
