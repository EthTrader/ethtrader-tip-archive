I believe this is finally the year crypto grows up!! After the 'crash' in a single day in October (because of leveraged positions) we saw just how fragile liquidity still is. Regulations are tightening everywhere so probably liquidity will consolidate to less venues. DeFi still needs deeper pools and better execution to handle institutional money. ETH got hit hard in this crash but on-chain metrics are very bullish so this could help with a recovery. Buy the dip.
