That’s a good insight, but we still need to make liquidity pool more attractive.

As we know impermanent loss is the main reason people hesitate to provide liquidity. If LPs had any kind of protection against big price swings, I think a lot more people would be willing to jump in.

Otherwise, I honestly don’t see things changing anytime soon - even though the rewards for LPs are already pretty decent.
