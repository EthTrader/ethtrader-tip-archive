What happened to the summary bot? OK here are the 3 points from the post:

* 1st: markets shake off the October liquidation crash. This year already added $170B cap so we are past it.
* 2nd: Senate passes the CLARITY Act soon. Clear US rules = growth.
* 3rd: stocks stay steady. A equity crash brings risk assets (like crypto) down but only short-term.
