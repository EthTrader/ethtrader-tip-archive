>How on earth are people earning nearly 45k. 

You may need to be little active to get that

•The easiest way is to put 5 to 6 text posts then you'll definitely hit the max. cap of 42500.

•Another way is to buy SM and use image/video or meme posts to reach the max of 42500.

I was doing that and hitting that max, but something went wrong with my UI. Now wen I try to buy SM, it says I already have an active membership - even after clearing my cache it didn't fix 😔. (Any idea about to fix that u/DBRiMatt)

Hopefully, above tips will help you to gain more Donut.
