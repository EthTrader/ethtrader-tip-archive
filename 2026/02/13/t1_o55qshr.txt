I'm not familiar with this one in particular, but I have known for there to be some creative users out there who have orchestrated puzzles with ETH wallets as the prize.

u/pixieshit has done a couple of these https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16a7g4r/i_created_a_black_mirrorstyle_game_around_1_eth/

But, as another user warned, be vigilant about what actions you are actually doing, as there are some bad actors out there.
