Buy low, sell higher.

There's really not much more to it.

And most of my ETH is elsewhere staking, so this is just a small percentage of play money really. So, even if I end up losing it, it's not going to be stressful.... that's probably the key part really.

For anyone else, I'd suggest the same, start small. Take just 2% or 5% of your crypto, and practice trading.
