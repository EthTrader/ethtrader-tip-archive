I agree. ETH verse BTC, whilst, overall has lost value, has had patchy moment, I guess last crypto winter ETH was undergoing it's major upgrade transition from PoW to PoS.

Recently the Fusaka upgrade and the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade, along with ETF and Treasury purchases, may help maintain sufficient interest that ETH's floor doesn't drop that far down again.

But, who knows. World be a bit fucked up right now!
