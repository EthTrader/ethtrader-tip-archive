We already hit 1.4k this bear, looking at the charts it mostly looks like BTC is entering a bear market due to much much it moved relative to its size.
We cant really say much about ETH because it essentially didnt move from the last few bearish years even the brief peak in 2025 did not exactly scream "bullish". It may still be in a bearish cycle but it probably never left as some had assumed in 2025.

Its entirely possible and even plausible that ETH and BTC have increasingly disconnected cycles as the last cycle already showed hints of that too. And also the assets are becoming very different over time not only in tokenomics and development but also usage.
