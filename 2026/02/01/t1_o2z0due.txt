Ethereum Mainnet is a lot cheaper now, definitely. 

There may be other options, but if you want to keep your wrapped bitcoin, you could possibly do a cross-chain swap via [Sushi.com](http://Sushi.com)

I don't have any WBTC on those networks, but I assume it can be done; with hopefully not much slippage/fees

There are probably some other bridges that support WBTC cross-chain, but I've only bridged ETH and USDC.

Have some $DONUT in the meantime!
