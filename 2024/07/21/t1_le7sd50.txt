Well, let me make it simple 

All ETF issuers fees are around 0.25% and only Grayscale is 2.5% 

Which means investors will choose other ETF issuers like Fidelity, Invesco, 21 Sahres over Grayscale 

At this point Grayscale will have less clients, so it’s either they fix their fees to match the rest of issuers or they’ll start selling and price dips
