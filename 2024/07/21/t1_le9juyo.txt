I knew that AI rule would into a shit show. That's why I voted YES. Sometimes you need people to hit a wall to realize things. The same way I tried to make people realize about the need of 3 posts limit and all equivalent r/cc rules implemented here.  \*evil laugh\*

Not sure about the solution though. Maybe nerfing news links to 0.5x (Ops! Sounds like another r/cc rule)
