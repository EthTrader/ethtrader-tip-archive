Great. Took a while to get adjusted to sushi swap. But i actually Love the Way it works. V3 pools are lovely. And sushiswap works well in many ways tbh. Im at the phase again where i Enter 100% of my donuts to the LP pool just to support the project. I Love that They finally added functionallity for the flair here and governance aswell. Works pretty awesome atm if you ask me. üëç !tip 1
