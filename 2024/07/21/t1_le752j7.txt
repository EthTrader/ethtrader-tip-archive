We've long needed a more detailed subset of rules; this could be prevented by employing some of the basic rules r/cc also implements to curb low quality spam.

7. Simple price speculation posts are not allowed. This includes posting portfolios and new price movement of a coin. Technical/charting analysis will be allowed depending on the quality.

8. Include sources. All articles must provide sources of the content provided on links to news websites. Low-quality articles, plagiarism, and speculative content will be removed. If the content in the articles is not concrete, then the authors must make that clear.

9. Questions and discussions which only belong in the daily discussion thread include: "rate my portfolio", "what coin should I buy?", â€œshill me a coin", "low-market cap coins", self-stories, etc.
