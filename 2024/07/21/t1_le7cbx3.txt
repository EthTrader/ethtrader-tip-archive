Theres plenty of benefits to CEX trading - both are good.

But DONUT being listed by a CEX is an unrealistic goal - MEXC for example have performance requirements that a token must maintain an average 50k trading volume per day, over the course of a month or else risk being deliisted.

We will not achieve that from a handful of users selling every month alone.
