>My initial thought is to have Seasons (Season 1, Season 2, etc) where each season would build (or add features) upon the previous season. An example of this would be:

Season 1 - Enable custom flair text
Season 2 - All features from Season 1 + allow users to post gifs and images
Season 3 - All features from Season 2 + allow users to post images, allow variables in custom flair text
Season 4 - All features from Season 3 + ???

According to Mattg, YES!
