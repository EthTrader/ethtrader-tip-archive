Yes. I didnt go for a very narrow range. There are so many ways to set it up and Trade accordingly. 
But if you set a very narrow it might take a lot of effort to ensure you stay in range at all times. ðŸ™‚

So Im not worried about if it goes up and Down as Long as Its nothing too crazy. The bigger the pool the more resistance against a pump and dump. 

And people Trade however They want anyways. ðŸ˜‚ Good luck with your donuts and ETH adventures.
