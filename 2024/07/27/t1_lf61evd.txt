Absolutely.

It's tokenomics are awesome, max supply, no  more minting... it still has a use-case, advertisers buy and burn... over 50k MOON burned this month, over 2 Mill Moon burned since the sunset.

As users hold, and advertisers keep buying, and supply is burned... hello supply shock!

Also, if for any reason, they become trending, they are listed on Kraken already.

Bullish AF on MOON
