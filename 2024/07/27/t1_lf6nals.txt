Some things just take some time. Do you remember the day Donut went up to 6c? I even wrote a post about it yesterday. I didn't sell because I thought the rocket had started with $3.5 million trading volume. 

Sometimes luck comes out of the blue. It's also sometimes the case that you're single for years and suddenly the one woman comes along who makes your life more beautiful when you've almost given up. 

There are many examples. That's why I'm a fighter even if I'm often beaten and I don't give up.
