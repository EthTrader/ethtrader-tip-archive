I read your message. It's similar in my case.

I have a monotonous job and sometimes I feel empty inside and just functioning. People don't talk to each other much because there are other political opinions. Things are different today than they were a  few years ago. But I still hope that it can turn the tide because the entire crypto market is still very small at around $2.5 trillion.

Many  have not yet recognized the potential. If you simply hold your coins, you may not become a millionaire in a few years, but you will earn a higher return than anywhere else.  I wish you a lot of strength and all  the best.

Keep your head held high. I always say it can only get better, it's already bad =)
