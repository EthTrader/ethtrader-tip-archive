It definitely hasn't dropped like other Solana projects after the airdrop and has been crabbing for now. Whatever i got from airdrop and the alpha vault, I'm still holding. The team seems to be good and active. Given how low the MC is, it does have a good potential. Not a financial advice though ðŸ˜Š
