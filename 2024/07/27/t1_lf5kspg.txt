I farmed all of the worst ones, but honestly I think itâ€™ll be the same story for any new Sol LP which comes out now 

I heard JitoSol was great, but only 30k addresses or so qualified and this was in January before the start of the airdrop rush

No idea how I could qualify for that - anyway, how much did you get from JitoSol and TNSR ?
