>  I never know which flair to use with price trends, etc posts and most of the times I try to convert them into a Discussion xD

This again is something I've tried to address in the past, or waiting for further mod input to actually change. But sometimes it's like headbutting a wall.

Took a month for Binance Twitter to finally get recognizably flaired correctly as media as per the existing rules.

As yes, agree, fluff and disclaimers, or "hey guys how's it going" "thanks for reading, let me know your questions in the comments below" should all be excluded for word counts when considering flair multipliers.
