>wall of text nobodys gonna read

I wish these online spaces were crowded with this kind of read, we all need to share thoughts and experiences in order to let others share empathy, advises or what they feel is right.

I feel what you are saying, and I have been close to there, at least for the work part. I left that job but only because I was lucky enough to be young and with a financial situation that could allow me a couple of months without an income...

Now I have a different job, a way better situation, but still not the one I need.

I think the drama of our society is that too many people feels like you.

What helped me a lot was to find activities I love outside the  work routine, and find there my happy moments. Even if for a tiny fraction of the day.

But I'm a positive person, so that's probably easier for.me...

anyway, there's really nothing I can say to improve your situation, just wanted to let you know that you are not alone in your struggle... this world is pretty messed up ü•∫

take care, the best you can‚ù§Ô∏è
