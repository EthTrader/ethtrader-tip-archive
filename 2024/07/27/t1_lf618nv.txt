I think all the flairs need some refinement... something which I have put forward myself already, but no action taken.

I've proposed a new flair specifically because the Trading flair sometimes is automatically applied to posts upon submission. This flair would need to be manually commanded, just like the OC flair.

There are also posts that could be flaired Trading which would not meet "Market Analysis" criteria.
