> If Shiba goes to $1, then I'll be a trillionaire

This guy talk like one of my uncle that invested in a shitcoins called "wakandainu" and told me how rich wakanda is and said he'll hold his coin till it reaches $1. I was just laughing. 

Turns out the person that shill the coin to him told him wakanda is a real place and they got resources. It's just funny how they're lots uneducated people out there that'll fall for cheap scam. !tip 1
