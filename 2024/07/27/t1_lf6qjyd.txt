Yea, the closest thing that can happen, in terms of centralization, is an entity controlling a large portion of the supply. But that can happen with any other coin or asset.

There are pools too, like Lido for example. I’m not fully sure, but there’s around 10 million eth staked with Lido, which is around 8% of the total supply.
