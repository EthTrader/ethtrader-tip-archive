ZKSync - 4 stars - pretty happy overall

BLAST - 4 stars - also pretty happy considering I did this one mostly passively

EtherFi - 2.5 stars... passive, but honestly expected better for myself considfering how much ETH I placed in.

Layer 3 - 2 stars - drop yet to come, I did expect a little better, but I  mightve missed out on early levels
