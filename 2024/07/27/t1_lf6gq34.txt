In england you must narrow down all school subjects at 15-16 yo to just 4, then study them 16-18, then you pick one and go to University. I did a maths bachelors degree as that was one of the only things I enjoyed, but it only qualifies you do become a maths teacher, very little work and you need to pay for a postgrad degree called a pgce to teach and I couldnt afford to do it.Â
