I feel your pain. Retraining may not sound like a good idea now but in a few years time are you just going to be in the same dead end job they doesn't make you happy anyway?

It might be worth actually considering retraining even if you can only do it part time and still have to work full time. I've been considering it myself recently. If I'd retrained when I first thought about it years ago it would be done now!

Also, invest invest invest! I think I've seen you're in the UK too. get yourself a S&S ISA if you don't already. Every little helps and you'll thank yourself years down the line
