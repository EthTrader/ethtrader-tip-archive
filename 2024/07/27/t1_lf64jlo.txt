In any case, my point still stands and I would be voting no, respectfully. This would add yet another layer of complexity to r/ethtrader. I believe it's time to simplify, not to complicate.

There are already way too many flairs in my opinion, so we should be removing some of them, not adding more.

Additionally, I'm not a fan of bonuses for other flairs, because what they really are is a penalty for everyone else. And worse, it opens room to any form of abuse, as is the case with Original Content flair. Anything with 500 words is being accepted as Original Content. what this does is penalize all those who are not adopting this meta.

I would prefer to nerf link posts, for example. This way, all other types of submissions would be rewarded, while lazy posts are penalized.

"Bonuses" are technically not bonuses, they're just penalties for everyone else. This is because there's a specific number of Donuts to be distributed each month. Example. If everyone decided to post submissions under the Original Content flair, guess what would happen to a small group that posts for example Sentiment or Discussion?
