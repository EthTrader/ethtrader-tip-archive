Possibly this. It's a way to try and give high effort posts more of a buff ahead of no effort posts.

I've tried in the past to get some more distinction on flair types, with no changes come, so now I've resorted to this proposal to create that distinction. 

Alternatively, someone could propose to nerf news links instead xD
