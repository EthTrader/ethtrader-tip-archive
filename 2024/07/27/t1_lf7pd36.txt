I would agree to post about other coins because we need to show that we are decentralized![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|stuck_out_tongue)

But on the other hand, I think we'll be flooded with people who don't like Ethereum, and the subs will be flooded with bullshit.

So far we are fine. The other coins have subs and when I want something I visit them.
