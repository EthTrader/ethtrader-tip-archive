Yeah if you've retained a positive outlook somehow then you're good, all these issues won't seem that bad to you. It doesn't change anything but it does make it bearable, then again you can't choose to feel any kind of way otherwise we'd all choose content/peace/happy all the time haha. Maybe I'm just a broken cynical person. Reminds me of a quote -Â
