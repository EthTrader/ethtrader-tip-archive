I can think of atleast 25 ERC Tokens that we can discuss here and actually there are more than 1000s of them. However, we are just stuck with Pepe and Shib news and have been limiting ourselves to look further into the Ecosystem.

This being a sub purely dedicated to Ethereum, discussing something outside its ecosystem just doesn't make sense to me personally.
