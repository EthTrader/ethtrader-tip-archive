Do you have any idea what to retrain as though? I don't have any interests or inclinations that I want to persue, I've never had anything that interests me or that I'm good at. The high paying jobs all demand extreme stress time or intellect and I have none of those and I'm not an artist or very creative enough for a modern youtube/internet/business/art thing. I don't have hobbies outside of gaming or sports, hate talking to people and so on.Â 


I can't afford to go part time so training part time and working would be the only viable choice but I'm not in the frame of mind and get too angry or sad to act on anything, I wasted quite a lot of money on therapy over the years as well and that's not helped.



Yeahhh uk and I have a stocks and shares isa making around 5% a year tax free. It was fine but only way to make strides on that is to have an insane initial investment and I have almost no spare money to do anything after the mortgage went up so high.
