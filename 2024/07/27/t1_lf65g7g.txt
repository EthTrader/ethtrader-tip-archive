Good points. I'd definitely agree simplicity will help, i've also suggested before if there was a way to reduce some of the flairs. 

Still waiting for moderation changes to reduce some flair types, or even simply incorporate the definitions of existing flairs - I've provided such clarity in previous posts already - but we still see self story based posts flaired as discussion.

I'd say a reason why there appears to be complexity and confusion is not because there are too many rules but because existing rules lack clarity and definition. 

R/cc for example, has a pretty lengthy expanded rules page, but it is so much easier to understand than what we have here.
