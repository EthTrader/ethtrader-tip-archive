just like all countries with crazy high inflation u get a weak currency that lowers people's purchasing power so people look for other currencies including crypto + gold & silver just to b able to keep their purchasing power, "their crazy inflation (the range is between 54% to 91%) ! maybe the second worst after Argentina & their currency from 1.17 per usd n 2008 to 33 per usd n 2024 ! - they should follow el salvador & make crypto a legal tender !
