The chain thing I can agree with. Maybe going back and fourth could be limiter somehow.

The other day, one regular went back and fourth in a chain about 9 times.

But 5 tips, *unless as a chain* makes no sense to me. We are like 20 active users, ofc people will be tipping the same people, more or less, on a daily basis
