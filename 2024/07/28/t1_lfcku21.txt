I like the theory, but I wouldn't support this without further amendments.

Self stories regardless of word count should remain as self stories, and simple questions should either be removed and redirected to the daily, or the question flair should also get a 0.25 multiplier. It's easy to add filler text to pad a word count without actually providing any meaningful addition to the post.

However, much like the feedback I received in my last proposal, It seems like the general consensus would just be to simply reduce the link post multiplier to 0.5 or 0.75 to help create a better balance between all content submissions. This would be a simple change that shouldn't be confusing for people.

It's great people are recognizing the current state of the sub and wanting to help improve the overall quality and variety of content.
