I trust the mods over there and think they know slow and steady wins the race. I like the fact they are sitting on such a healthy treasury and not rushing to do anything with it

I liked the talks about getting a listing cause they know we need to wait to get the likes of kraken rarher than rushing for some shitty listing. They could go and do what GONE did right now (which wasn't even actually a listing) but it would be foolish just like it was foolish for GONE to do it 

I'm happy to sit back and build the Cone bag
