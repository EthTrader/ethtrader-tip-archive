Most Republicans/Trump supporters on Reddit probably keep that fact to themselves considering Reddit is 90% triggered Democrats

I agree. Some of the comments I've seen over on r/cc coming from Democrats recently have been crazy. They seem incapable of having a rationale conversation 

With that said don't forget we are on Reddit. If we were on Rumble it would be Republicans saying outlandish things that would stand out more
