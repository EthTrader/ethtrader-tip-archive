Oh yeah in terms of impact a nearly 90% drop in price from 6 cents, 250 members less this round after over half the people left or got banned. That sort of thing, it's fact based stuff. The toob finance thing, donation to coneheads, new rules in the sub, advertising the banner, tip to vote, all of those things have objectively had little to no positive impact on sub growth, sub rank, sub engagement, token price, trade volume, new members, new holders, visibility etc. 


In my personal opinion all of those things are definitely good, there's a few people working behind the scenes and I'm sure their impact might be felt at some point in the future just not reflected in any of the important stats or metrics yet.
