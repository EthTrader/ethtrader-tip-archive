Yeah probably because there's no one solution to figure out. People are very smart, if all these minds thinking and running these projects can't figure it out I'd be seriously considering that this is just one of this system's big flaws. Every system has inefficiencies blind spots, attack vectors. This is certainly one of the glaring ones with rcps - the top earners definitely do it via high effort repetition on a daily grind and not often enough (there is lots of quality but top earners do it by high comment and post count) by quality, they call it engagement and I say the truth is that spending 12 hours a day and leaving hundreds if not thousands of short comments a month is obviously spam.
