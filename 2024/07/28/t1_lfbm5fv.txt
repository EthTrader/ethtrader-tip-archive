I think the entire market, not just eth, is in an extremely delicate position. Like a balloon about to burst. And all this due to the elections. Take a look at what happened to bitcoin's price yesterday, during Trump's speech. Did you see the volatility?

At the moment, prices are "dormant", and await the results of the elections. The market will either explode all the way up to the moon, or a huge correction is imminent, possibly a second crypto winter.
