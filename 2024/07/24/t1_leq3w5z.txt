It depends on how much you have on your wallet.  For example,  you have $10 worth of eth, after 3 days  you sold  and earn $3. Is different from someone who bought $4000 eth and made profits of $40. 

How much you bag matter to take profits or not.  Your $10 eth for long period can only earn you 40- 70 in 4 years time
