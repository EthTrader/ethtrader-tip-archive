>I like 50 comments cap but I think we should remove "Good bot", tip status, post status, Automod commands, etc from the counting towards the cap.

I think this is achieved by not worrying about comment cap specifically, but rather, comments that have been tipped.

Lets say the cap is 50, you make 200 comments, but reduced rewards come in from 50th tip, rather than 50th comment.

I assume that might be easier for the tooling bots to compute as well.
