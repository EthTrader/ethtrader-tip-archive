Ethereum ETFs debuted on American stock exchanges with a combined trading volume of $1 billion following SEC approval in May. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust led with $461 million, followed by BlackRock’s iShares Ether Trust and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund. So all together they accumulated over $1bn trading volume and still no effect on price.
I hope this helps you get it better
