Thank you, Im glad you like it. I did stumble on the rank while doing some research on sushi swap. 👍

Seems the transfer to arbitrum was a good choice and from here on we Can grow the sub and enjoy a active eco system and a great L2. 📈
 
The shuttle worked Well too. All in all, a healthy project if you ask me… Ive been arround for about 4 years now.
