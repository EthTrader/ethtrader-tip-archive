I've done a few things on Scroll myself, early days airdrop farming, but definitely was a more expensive chain to use. I'm currently still earning some marks from liquidity provision - but too early to tell if Scroll will be one of the leaders going forward.

I do think ZK rollups will eventually take a lead over Optimistic rollups.
