I agree. People expected some miracle green lines when ETFs started trading. They need to realise, this is long term process. Going forward, more and more people wlll start to invest into ETH ETFs because its easy for newbies now to enter in this eco system. BlackRock and Fidelity are big names that will draw the crowd.

There will be more adoption, more use cases, more and more people will start to understand crypto. That should result more inflows into Ethereum and eventually, price will follow
