>ETH is the high-quality liquid asset of crypto. Thanks to modular scaling, it will be bridgeable to countless rollups with minimum trust assumptions. If this thesis is correct then it may even overtake Bitcoin someday. Itâ€™s still early, and memetics and momentum trump fundamentals in crypto valuations.

My major take in this article. The author felt the need to compare Solana and ETH and I just can't fathom why.
They're not in the same class.
