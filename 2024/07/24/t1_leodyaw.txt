Wall Street is the home of global finance. Big banks, investment firms, hedge funds. It's the traditional financial hub. They're professional money makers. They know there's a lot of money to be made in the crypto space. They're here to make money.

Wall Street's entry into crypto could mean great things for the market. They could bring stability and legitimacy, to what's considered a volatile and unpredictable space.

Also, they're not here "for the tech". They're here to make profit, and they'll do whatever it takes to come out on top.
