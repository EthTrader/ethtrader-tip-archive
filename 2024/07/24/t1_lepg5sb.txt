I kept trying this sort of thing when I first joined, the ideas rarely go anywhere and rarely worth the time or effort. Continue trying for definite, 1000 shite ideas and one gem you end up with the gem.. but it's a heck of a lot of effort and it's draining irl to be spending time like this when the outcome is usually being ignored. 

Old me would sit and write out a thousand words on all the issues and now almost a year later the issues have not been addressed sufficiently. Now I just save my energy and preserve the mental peace lol.
