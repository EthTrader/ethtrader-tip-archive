I would like to but I'm afraid I can't make a decent proposal since I'm not a native speaker. I may be insufficient to explain my proposal perfectly. Even that post took me a lot of time to write to express myself clearly / finding the best words to use. I hope I can find the will to create a proposal tho. Do you know when is the time to make a proposal? Thanks for the feedback.
