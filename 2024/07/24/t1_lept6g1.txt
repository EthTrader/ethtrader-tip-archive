Even with the inconvenience of a different wallet address, Starknet is doing well. Linea is not bad. I'll definitely put Linea at the top of Taiko.
I used Taiko a few times at the early stage. It was worrisome with transactions fails, delayed transaction and steep charges.
It might be better now, but I haven't used it again.
