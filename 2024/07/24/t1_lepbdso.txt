And all those reasons are why a small $5000 trade can cause a significant movement on the charts of micro-caps like DONUT.

ETH probably had some unfortunate timing where there was some overall market downtrends with Mt Gox sell pressure too - but the fact it's remained crabbish in my mind is a good thing. Means we didn't dump hard after the fact, and such news iis more about the long term exposure.
