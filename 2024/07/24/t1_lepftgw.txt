I'd say those big swings aren't a good thing, because it opens room for manipulation. A single whale can control the entire micro-market of tokens such as Donut. We've seen it before, multiple times. 

Shrimps either ride the wave and capitalize on these swings, or are left with heavy bags. This doesn't favor a project in any way, and drives away investors and potential partners.

That's why it's important to focus on real utility, and constantly snowball. So that the market is less and less affected by whales.
