That's my thoughts as well, 3 is a good balance, sure, some users will use all 3 every single day, other's wont. But the multiplier is how we can improve the overall variety of content. If Comedy was any higher, we'd just have low quality memes spammed all the time - instead, users pick and choose only better quality ones, to reduce the chance of not "breaking even"

Given the average number of tips the average user gets, I'd probably support 0.75 over 0.5 for link posts. It's still far more than Comedy which is 0.25.
