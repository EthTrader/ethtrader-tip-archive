I think it's just that I've been here a while now, almost a year, and the dynamic has always been the exact same -

An unfixable problem like human greed inspires an unimplementable solution, and the middle ground viable one creates a newer more complicated problem, the first bunch of people forget or deny the unwinnable nature of people, then come up with a newer solution for the newer problem, and implement a thing that creates yet another even newer problem.

The issue is not the problems, but the lack of ability to integrate these truths into the process for next time. To me as an outsider it looks a lot like an OCD loop of compulsion that you can't break out of, ultimately expecting a different result by trying the same thing over and over again.

Even Reddit themselves say if you don't like the platform you can easily find another one. We should do the same. Accept that these issues are not gonna stop on the internet or with people in general and it's a heck of a waste of human attention to keep throwing piles of shite at a wall and pretending the one turd that stuck is the final answer to everything.
