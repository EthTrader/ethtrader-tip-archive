>Similar to the experience with Grayscaleâ€™s Bitcoin Trust, outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust are not entirely unexpected. With an expense ratio of 2.5%, ETHE is the most expensive US ETF that invests directly in Ethereum.

The outflows wouldn't have been this much, if Grayscale didn't raise their fees a lot higher than others.
