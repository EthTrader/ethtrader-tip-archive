>Ikkurty conducted numerous webinars and trade shows to recruit participants to the scheme, promising steady returns of 15% per year in “net profits”.

>Hyping up the success of his digital asset fund, Ikkurty claimed to invest in “stable” digital assets and would gain confidence by misrepresenting his success. Ironically, the CFTC found that his actual experience with crypto and digital assets “consisted of losing his personal Bitcoins to a hack“.

>Ikkurty didn’t provide any returns on investments to his customers. Ikkurty was described as running “something akin to a Ponzi scheme”. Judge Rowland concluded that the scheme’s marketing materials misstated the fund’s historical performance, omitting that the fund’s value fell 98.99% over a few months.

This is a classic alright. Knowing the SEC, they would've probably tried to label it a security instead.
