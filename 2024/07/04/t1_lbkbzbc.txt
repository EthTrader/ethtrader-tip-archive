>I agree with that, I'm starting to not be a fan of the Tip Status command - I prefer an element of surprise with the CSV and I agree it plastering the Tip Stats now doesn't seem to share so much generosity anymore as it does tip performance.

At least people sh0ould be charitable to seek their tip status in a dead thread. Not an active daily. It can be demoralizing. ðŸ˜‚ 

>I don't find it intimidating persay, but there still are levels of concern - when obvious AI posts get more tips than other posts because it was posted by a 'topper' - and when genuine and relevant posts or comments get ignored because they were posted by an unregistered user or 'shrimp'.

I couldn't have said this any better.
