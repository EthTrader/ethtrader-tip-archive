Asset tokenization is going to be the next big thing in the financial world, and Ethereum is leading the way. I truly think that tokenization is the next major price catalyst for eth's price.

More industries are already adopting this tech, we can expect a significant boost in eth's value and influence in the financial sector. This is what I think, at least.
