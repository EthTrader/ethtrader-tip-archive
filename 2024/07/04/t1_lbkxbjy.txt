The real bottleneck for Ethereum is block confirmation times, which can take minutes and lead to high gas fees. EIP-7732 aims to improve scalability by reducing these confirmation times, making transactions faster and cheaper. 

Think of it as the difference between getting stuck in rush hour traffic (slow confirmations) vs. cruising on a green light highway (fast confirmations). Essentially, EIP-7732 is about making Ethereum feel faster, even if the raw transaction speed doesn't change dramatically. 

Still confusing?
