So far my calculations are over 100k additional CONTRIB to be awarded to various users.

Sadly, There were 25 unique voters all up, but only 4 users had voted in the first 3 weeks, and then only 1 of those voted in the final week. 

I sat out of voting in 1 week as well knowing this would be a criteria I set to disqualify myself :P
