I agree with that, I'm starting to not be a fan of the Tip Status command - I prefer an element of surprise with the CSV and I agree it plastering the Tip Stats now doesn't seem to share so much generosity anymore as it does tip performance.

 I've found myself less interested in sharing the tip status command. I'm not here to keep track of tips every hour and make sure I'm meeting some sort of "performance goal" either.

As for being "out of the race" - I guess, if you were to take a week off under the old reward model, same thing.

Tv2 has obviously helped reduce downvotes, but it hasn't specifically addressed a problem of rewarding 'quality content' - and many posts/comments do get tips based on who posted them, rather than what was posted. 

I don't find it intimidating persay, but there still are levels of concern - when obvious AI posts get more tips than other posts because it was posted by a 'topper' - and when genuine and relevant posts or comments get ignored because they were posted by an unregistered user or 'shrimp'.
