Updoot/downdoot system is a proven feature for multimillionaire companies. It has its flaws of course but it is user friendly.

I dont feel intimidated by T2V but it is boring af. I can accept it with posts but with comments... it feels anti nature and most of the times I forgot about it. Another solution is to add karma count towards the final result too in a less strong way like 25% of the karma earned count or something like that, the "public vote".
