> Daily discussion doesn't really need tips.

Kinda agree. I wouldn't object to reducing the multiplier on the daily further. A lot of people say it's great to "just hang out and have some fun" - and you can absolutely do that without incentivized rewards.

Tip something because it's genuinly funny, not because you expect to get tipped back and be rewarded for it.
