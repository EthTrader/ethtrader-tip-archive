Aminok has already said he would not support any reversion back to the upvote model. 

It's hard to think of anything else that would provide fair rewards, but with minimal manipulation. Downside to pure T2V is it simply being a popularity contest - and someone saying thanks and youre welcome can have the exact same voting reward as someone who just spent several minutes sleuthing through the blockchain to help someone out.

Under the voting model truly helpful comments would usually score multiple votes. On the flipside, subject to manipulation, a user spamming good bot could easily score hundreds of donuts as well.
