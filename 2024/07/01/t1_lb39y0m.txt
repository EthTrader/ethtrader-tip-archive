I expect up and then down and then some up, hopefully followed by more up ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

I do think there will be some sell the news type event, but ultimately the merger of OCEAN AGIX and FET should bring upon an ASI token of more value than FET currently stands at

It's probably the token I've successfully swing traded the most this year

I've already bought some, just waiting to see if I'll buy some more
