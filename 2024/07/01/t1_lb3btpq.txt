Yeah people have been having a hard time calculating the points per token because of all the retro points they still need to add in the dashboard. Thankfully we only have to wait 4 more days for the checker. A few million points should be nice. Apparently there were some unclaimed tokens from S1 that will be added to the S2 distribution, so hopefully it's a nice little boost.
