Interesting. Do you prefer Crypto.com’s card over Gate.io’s or Coinbase’s card, for example?

Because crypto.com’s interface is not the best, and the spread is unbearable. The problem with the card is that you have to top it up with fiat, and when you do you can’t execute transfers, only withdrawals in Fiat too.
