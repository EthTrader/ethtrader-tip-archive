Hey Aminok

My suggestion about some kind of crossover event with r/ConeHeads shouldn't require any dev work from the mods here. Coneheads already support off chain tipping for multiple tokens. It would just require an amount of Donuts and someone to reach out to them 

They have already had donuts on there previously which required no work from over here. I think it was one of their mods who actually donated the donuts when they were doing an event where all RCC's could be earned through posts including Moons etc 

I have off chain donuts on the bot over there now I could withdraw. Just trying to think of ways to onboard new users and I think this could be a good way to onboard some
