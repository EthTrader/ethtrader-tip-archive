News articles never helped. They give basic info and that's all. To learn about any project or crypto in general, YouTube is your best bet. Watch many videos on the subject and practice while you watch. Helped me a lot.
Telegram is also good, if you know your way around. You just have to avoid thousands of scammers waiting for their chance to scam you. !tip 1
