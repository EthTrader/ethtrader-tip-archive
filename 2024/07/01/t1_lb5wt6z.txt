The idea is essentially allowing users on r/ConeHeads to earn Donuts through posts on their sub for a limited time to promote Ethtrader/Donuts

The bot over there already has multiple tokens that can be earned and tipped off chain. They've had a promo before where you could actually earn Donuts through posts briefly but it wasn't an Ethtrader thing it was ConeHeads allowing all RCC's to be earned for a limited time. If you earned donuts during that time you can actually still tip them off chain over there and withdraw through their bot

Obviously someone would need to reach out to one of the mods there and suggest the idea and figure out how many Donuts it would take for what length of time. Assuming something was agreed, proposed and approved then it would go something like promotion starts on X date and one of us (probably you) makes a post on Coneheads about the promotion and ethtrader. Then we can get some engagement from users over there that may join here too.

I see nearly every user from ethtrader on ConeHeads but the vast majority of ConeHeads aren't on ethtrader. I assume that's because they don't know enough about or haven't been engaged enough to hop over here and check it out. 

It would benefit us by hopefully onboarding new users and of course would benefit ConeHeads as they will get higher engagement on their own sub due to people being able to earn Donuts as well Cone. I've seen Ethtrader discussed in the coneheads chat before and people are put off by not understanding the rules. 

If we did some sort of promotion like this it would be a great opportunity to have them ask their questions on the promotion post. 

Anyway that's basically the idea. Obviously it would cost donuts and I'd be happy to donate 10k of my own towards it if we can't use treasury funds
