Sounds good! I'm using the CEX to bridge INJ, but I'll probably keep paying the TIA fee. Also doing Renzo and Merkly, I've also tried to use some other bridges, like Nautilus and Forma; providing TIA/ETH liquidity in TraderJoe as well. I've probably hit Hyperlane 2 or 3 times depositing in Superform
