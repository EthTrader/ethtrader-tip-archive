>The new accounts posting on front-page rarely get tips, because they have little or no "weight" and they're also seen as alt accounts. How can they feel welcomed when everyone avoids their posts?

Realistically, this is a user mindset issue, not a moderation issue. You're absolutely right though, it is an issue and theres no denying that.

I don't understand the mindset of not tipping somebody because they don't have 20k governance... if you tip; them 1 donut, and they tip you 1 donut, you each get your 1 donut. There is no loss. Sure, there is different gains, but there is no loss - and it's really embarrassing that users get so precious over less than 1 cent.

It's not possible, because we are stuck on reddit platform, but I'd love to see how different tipping results would look if user names were hidden and all submissions were anonymous, with only mods able to see the user behind the submission.
