> Only a few(and you are one of them) are tipping me back. My voting powrr is around 0.33 i believe, so thats probably not enough for people to tip me back.

Which is also a silly mindset, because if you're tipping 1 donut, and getting tipped 1 donut, you're not losing anything. Even if the voting weight is different. 

It's a shame we can't hide governance scores AND user names, and people can tip based on content, rather than based on who wrote it. xD
