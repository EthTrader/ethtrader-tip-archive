I agree with you. In next period, we will see no new users, some of the old members will leave. 

Btw i think T2V is great system for posts, you cant cheat anymore, but next problem is mindset of many people in the sub. If i cant earn donuts from your tip, i wont engage on your comments and posts, simple as that. Of course, there are people who are exception and i have huge admiration for them.
