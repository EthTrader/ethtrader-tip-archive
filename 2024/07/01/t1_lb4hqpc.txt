The rules on RCC are relatable to every Reddit member, because most of the rules apply to other subs, with a few exceptions.
Any active Redditor in any sub, can jump into R/CC, post and make comments, at the end of the round, they earn moons.

In r/ethtrader, they will need to snuggle and kiss a lot of ass(es), if they plan to have any chance of earning donuts.

The front-page posts is an example. The new accounts posting on front-page rarely get tips, because they have little or no "weight" and they're also seen as alt accounts.
How can they feel welcome when everyone avoids their posts? !tip 1
