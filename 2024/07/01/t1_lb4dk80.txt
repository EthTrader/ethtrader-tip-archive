Hmm, I somewhat disagree. There are FAR more rules on r/cryptocurrency but that sub continues to be a top 3 crypto sub and has quite a healthy balance of range of topics.

What sucks is the majority of new users in the last 3 months turned out to be most of the alt accounts banned in the last few rounds.
