T2V definitely destroyed the sub in my opinion. Ofcourse, it has reduced the cheaters. 

But it has also heavily reduced the genuine Users. I just don't feel it anymore to come here everyday with the forced tipping somehow..

Tipping should be optional and not forced. Nevertheless, I don't know a solution instead of separating typing and upvoting again..
