> I think cryptorader is a good idea. But we barely have enough members here and a sister sub could be a dead sub

Well, it's not like cryptotrader will suddenly have a straight up and running rewards system next month. This proposal is more about getting support to do so, it could take several months to fully get together a moderation team, rewards formula, rules etc.

But nobody is going to put in all that work if the idea isn't supported in the first place.
