If I only had time to play to earn like when I was a teenager...

My clan was at Worldwide Top 7 on Killzone 2 online and we were just me and a friend. TLDR; We were good.

Had a chance back then to jump into some amateur "pro" gamer stuff but it wasn't trendy on that time and decided to just study and play football xD
