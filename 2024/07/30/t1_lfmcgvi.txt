big question, it depends on so many things.

I only started cumulating eth some months ago when price was $1.6k and then sold all of it a few weeks ago with 2x profit in order for me to lay for my summer vacation.

Then I started cumulating again, so I guess I'll sell as soon as the profit is enough for me to be spent somewhere else 😁
