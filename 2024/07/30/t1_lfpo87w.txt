>The art lacked originality. It was a copycat of a project on another chain. The art looked very similar to another NFT project

How will someone invest in an NFTs that's a derivatives of another?

>boat cruise for all NFT holders".

Lmao, they were tryna be the original YATCH CLUB

>how the price would go to the moon.

Once people realised the developers can't predict what the NFTs price will be, they smarter they'll become

>were being listed for lower prices, thus dropping the floor price. Real holders who had minted were making losses because of the falling floor price.

Tbh most NFTs are like that. Even reddit avatars aren't different 

>The admins and mods went quiet just after the mint

They're goal was to sell out and rugged people. They're bigger scum than Zagabond.

>The team kept saying there would be an airdrop for all NFT holders. It's usually a trick to get people to mint

People tends to believe in airdrop when the actual project isn't a success yet. Yuga Labs airdrops was a success because YUGA'S NFTs was already successful. Most people who fall for all these are newbies or greedy people who want to get rich quick.

Thanks for the write-up though. !tip 1
