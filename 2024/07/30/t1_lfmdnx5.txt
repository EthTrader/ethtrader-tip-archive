well, I guess it depends on the plans we have. I'm not good with crypto investing or trading, so I couldn't aim for a x100 profits, I know I would screw that up ðŸ˜…

I'm not even greedy, I just want to steadily increase my wealth using crypto, and ETH and BTC are helping me in doing so

with BTC the thing is bit different tho, I have been increasing my stash since 2017 and only DCAed out some profit 3 or 4 times along the way. I'm holding most of my bag for what's to come ðŸ˜Ž
