For me its simple i have main wallets and then my daily use wallets.

 The main wallets i never connect to anything at all. Those are just to hold my assets. 

The daily use wallets doesn't have significant amount, so incase anything goes south i won't be losing much. But still while using those wallets i double chk everything.
