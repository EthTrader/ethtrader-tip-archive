That's it pretty much! CONTRIB can't be transferred or sold like Donuts and can only be earned through distribution on the sub.

We use the CONTRIB for governance and you'd need the Donuts to match. For example I have 100k CONTRIB but have sold 50k donuts leaving me with 50k donuts my vote would be worth 50k not 100k.

The CONTRIB would still be at 100k so I could buy back 50k to make up the 100k weight! So the whales who have very large amounts of CONTRIB have been here for a long time. A whale couldn't just come along and buy a load of Donuts to influence votes.

There are a lot more rules over here compared to the more relaxed subs but for good reason! Might take a bit to get used to them but if you stick around you'll understand them in no time!
