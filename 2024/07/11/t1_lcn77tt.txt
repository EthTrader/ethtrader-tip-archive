I should definitely have added, Sushi actually responded very quickly and handled the situation quite well. From memory, some users even managed to get their funds back (Though I'm not entirely sure of those circumstances, if they were retrieved or simply reimbursed)

Their handling of the situation and ongoing developments is one of the reasons why I continue to use them as one of my preferred DEX's.

I have also had quick and effective communication on the occasion I did need to reach out to their Discord support with a ticket.
