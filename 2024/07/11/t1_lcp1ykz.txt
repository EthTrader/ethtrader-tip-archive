I feel safe. But, it's nice to get these little reminders to not get complacent. 

Most people that report getting siphoned or "hacked" often say they are pretty tech savvy and take precautions, but almost always it turns out they either got complacent, thought this stuff never happens to them, and then they lose all their funds because the visited a clone website, put their private seed into somewhere they shouldn't have, signed a malicious contract etc.

It's good to have a small sense of danger for your own protection.
