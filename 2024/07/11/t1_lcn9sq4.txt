>Can sidechains ever truly match the security of the Ethereum mainnet? Ô∏è

Good question

Achieving the same level of security is a challenge because sidechains require a bridge to link to the mainnet, which automatically brings a little vulnerability.

I hope at the back Devs are doing relentless work to enhance the security.
