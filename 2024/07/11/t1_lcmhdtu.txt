ALGO's supply inflation was also insanely high - but perfectly timed so that unlocks and selling was occurring during the midst of a euphoric bull run - so the price actually continued to go up while these unlocks and sales were happening...

it wasn't until the bear market and things like TERRA collapsing, the BTC sells that really slaughtered ALGO's price, which, thanks to the increased supply, would never recover.


As for comparing ARB and MATIC... not sure, i'm not the greatest at actual blockchain detection - but, atleast with Polygon, MATIC is used for gas fees, so there is actual use of the  token. ARB is just purely a governance token.
