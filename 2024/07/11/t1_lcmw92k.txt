Algo was a soft rug. 

Nothing can recover if there's a single entity that holds close to half of the entire supply and sells for hundreds of millions in a bear market. 

Every single holder out there got rekted by being the Foundation's exit liquidity. Suspect they used bot accounts on Reddit as well to pump up the sentiment and attract more people to buy/hold, every critical comment on Algo was heavily downvoted back then
