Get ready to be surprised.

It's a matter of jurisdiction, really. There are situations where the US can influence or regulate matters beyond its direct control. They have enacted laws with extraterritorial reach, which means they apply to actions outside US borders under certain conditions. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices doesn't allow companies and citizens to bribe foreign officials, even if the bribery is outside of US soil.

They can also do international treaties / agreements, with other nations.

Then there are sanctions. Their most common "trap card" is economic and trade sanctions, to influence behavior in other countries. For example what they did with Russia.
