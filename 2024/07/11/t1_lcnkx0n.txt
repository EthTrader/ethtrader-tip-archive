This industry is infested with corruption. Years ago, BitMEX was accused of trading against its own customers. They have / had access to margin call and liquidation levels. They used to short bitcoin to cause price drops, thus liquidating everyone and profiting on the dumps. The same would happen for Longs.

They were playing Uno, but could see everyone else's cards.

It's because of this that I'm reluctant to trade on Cexs.
