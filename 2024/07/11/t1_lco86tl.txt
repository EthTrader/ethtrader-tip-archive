This headline looks like anti-cex propaganda. 

A cex is a bridge between TradFi and DeFi. If funds come from DeFi and people want to sell for fiat, then they will use a cex. No matter the source.

Of course, it's the exchange's responsibility to make sure illicit funds don't get cashed out. They usually do a pretty good job with that.
