About 25% of eth's total circulating supply is locked in staking on the Ethereum network. We're talking about around $85 billion. This reduces the supply available for trading, which naturally impacts market dynamics.

Imagine if 50% of the circulating supply gets locked. With institutional demand and less supply available, the price would skyrocket.
