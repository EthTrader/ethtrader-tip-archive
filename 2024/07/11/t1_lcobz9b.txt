Centralised crypto exchanges are worse than you think. Several times they've gotten calls to delay or freeze accounts of suspected hackers/scammers, they ignored the request.
They only cooperate when the funds involved in the hack/scam is huge, and cannot be easily covered up. I don't trust them one bit. !tip 1
