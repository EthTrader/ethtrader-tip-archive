Of all these, the one I prefer the most is Revolut. I've been a user for years and never had a single problem. The smallest inconveniences I had were resolved by their support relatively quickly.

It's not something I advise for crypto, though. At least for now. Mainly because there isn't much offer, and the fees are high.
