This is interesting. Just a few days ago, the Turkish Parliament passed a bill introducing new regulations on crypto:

> Individuals and legal entities operating as crypto asset service providers without authorization will face imprisonment for 3 to 5 years.

> Unauthorized individuals and legal entities operating as crypto asset service providers will face imprisonment from 3 to 5 years and judicial fines ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 days. Service providers misappropriating money or assets entrusted to them, including crypto assets, will face imprisonment from eight to 14 years and fines of up to 5,000 days and must compensate for damages.
>
>If the crime involves deceitful actions to conceal embezzlement, the perpetrator will face imprisonment from 14 to 20 years and fines of up to 20,000 days. The judicial fine cannot be less than three times the damage caused to the service provider and its clients.
>
>Individuals found to have illegally used the resources of a revoked crypto asset service provider for personal or third-party gain will face imprisonment from 12 to 22 years and fines up to 20,000 days.

And now Binance is leaving. Somethingâ€™s not right.
