The ability to pay devs or partners ETH directly would be much more appealing then giving them our native token. This can expand potential partners and personnel at our disposal. 

Or lets say, we do decide to fork out for that CEK listing (probably a poor example), and it costs 100k USDC... We can convert our ETH in the treasury to pay for that without suddenly tanking the price of DONUT in 1 hit.
