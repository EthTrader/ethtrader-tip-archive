Nice proposals, thanks for your work!

I really like the first proposal. Finally a way to gain more CONTRIB score.

Regards the last proposal: Wouldn't the convertion of 75k Donuts to ETH every month create huge sell pressure at the current trading volumes?

I guess this would dump the price every month a little bit lower because the trading volume is very low at the moment.
