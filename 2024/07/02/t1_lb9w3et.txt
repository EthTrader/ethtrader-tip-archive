Theyâ€™re in debt to me. ðŸ˜Ž

Seriously now, when governments are in debt, the entities collecting this debt are basically the investors and institutions that buy government bonds and other debt stuff (securities, instruments).

Examples:

Individual and institutional investors, like pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies, buy government bonds.

Banks and other financial entities hold large amounts of government debt as part of their portfolios as well. Then thereâ€™s central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, that also HODL government debt as part of their monetary policy operations.

Additionally, a lot of countries invest in the debt of other nations as a way to diversify their reserves, and earn a return on their investments.

These debts are basically promises to pay the holders of government bonds and securities, who invested as a ***relatively*** safe way to profit.

Hopefully that makes sense.
