>Do we have only hopium dealers? Are we lacking genuine analysts who possess extensive knowledge and experience in the cryptocurrency market? Are we really seeking confirmation bias? 

The users I know that actively trade and use TA have mostly be driven away from this sub due to low quality content that gets pushed to the top. When "what is DYOR" or "what is a dex" hits the top, gets the most reward, and actual analysis gets ignored, they stop bothering.
