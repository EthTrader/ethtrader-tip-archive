Normally I try to find cons in all proposed initiatives and governance proposals, but I can't find anything in this personally. Seems like a well thought idea overall.

The sub has improved a lot compared to what it was 4-6 months ago. This will definitely add to the further improvements.

However, this will need extensive work from the devs. I guess its time to knock on the treasury doors.
