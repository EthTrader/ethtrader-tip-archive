Pretty much all of them in the Sushi pool - maybe an exception for those who have only joined in the last few weeks, if there are any - but the majority of positions have been up since around the same time I started data tracking.

The thing about the weekly updates I've been providing on my position is you can essentially use that data and apply the same percentages to smaller positions. It comes down to only miniscule number, something like -2.5%
