I won’t say all, but I’ve been waiting for an airdrop for the last 9 months and still no news and they just partnered with another project and to keep farmers calm they introduced a first come first serve basis, and for my bad luck I was sleeping 

Second attempt, it got frozen Because of thousands of bots 

So airdrops is not something to build hope for
