With stable coin pairings i like the thought of basically buying up dips. So when you are confident in the other asset compared to the stable coin you will by the dips automatically. If you then exit at these periods you will have more of the other asset.
Same goes for selling you can sell on rates and get some extra fee rewards while doing it, eg in a bullrun.
The Negativ of this approach is you will always get a mean rather than hitting the exact top/bottom.
