They are supposed to be a deterrent so they've been fined now and shouldn't want to get fined again so they will make their onboarding policies more in line with regulations. They can risk losing their FCA license if they do it again which would result in a huge loss of revenue 

I can give you an example. I know of a company personally in the UK that got fined by the regulator last year and told to stop doing this particular thing they were doing. They got caught doing the same thing a few months ago and no fine this time they got their FCA license taken away and as of now are no longer in business. Not crypto related but same regulator
