Fair enough, CDC still giving cashback?

No idea, you should look it up if its available over there.

Yeah soon its possible to get a creditcard from ether.fi, im still not sure if i want to pay the annual ether fee but its maybe worth it because you can pay off the debt with the points we earn there.
