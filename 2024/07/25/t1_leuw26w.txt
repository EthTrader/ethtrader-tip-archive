I've personally used this price action to exit my ETH/USDC liquidity positions - made some pretty good fees in the last few days decided to take this opportunity while it was available.

I was hoping it would drop a little further initially, but given that's not a guarantee, I acted before I wrote this post, getting pretty close to the bottom for the day.
