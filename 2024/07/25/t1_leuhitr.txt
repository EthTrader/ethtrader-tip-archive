Nah, just sharing his opinion. I think that those kind of posts are quite useful to bring newbies to the sub and also teach things to people. We use to forget that even the most basic things in crypto are not easy for average people. If I got a DONUT for each time I have been asked about transactions or transfers at crypto I would have a private island.

This reminds me a little to scientists. The feeling you will leave with after asking them things that are basic to them is that they are total d\*\*s. We never have to forget that there was a time when we were dumb regarding crypto.

Anyway, this "What is", "How to" Meta is better than the Meta of creating a OC posts, wait some hours and changing the flair to OC after that (Again not referring to DBR, just things I have seen). For me that is a banneable offense equivalent to changing the flair from Media to 1x flair after some hours and with a much more selfish objective.
