Ok this is wild, because I just saw an ad about the card on Twitter, and was wondering if anyone here uses it.

So far I see two downsides:

* KYC (I guess this is a common standard nowadays)

* Paying with a specific coin on Gnosis (Most of us don’t really use Gnosis anymore after the migration. So that’s just a few additional steps)

So I guess I have a few questions:

1. Does the card have maintenance fees?

2. Is there any limit for transactions, such as withdrawals / payments?

3. Does it allow you to withdraw to a bank account, or is it specifically for payments only? I guess probably the latter.

4. What’s the coin used to top up the card?

5. Any kind of hidden fees at all? Payment fees, whatever?

6. How much is the card?
