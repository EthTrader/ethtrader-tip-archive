This is my bet

>My take on this dump is that it is a mix between ETH ETFs sell the news event + Joe Biden speech a few hours ago + speculation about the upcoming data today like PIB (Quarterly), US Weekly Unemployment Claims and US Durable Goods Orders + some tech companies like Google earnings report. All of these events are the perfect formula to make the market move.

Pretty sure it is a mix of events
