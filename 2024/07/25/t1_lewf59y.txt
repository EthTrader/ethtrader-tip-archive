Hey ray. Quick question regarding posting now the that you posted it.

I've had posts removed for not being sub related rules and those were posts about crypto hacks and exchanges.

This posts doesn't even mention crypto, it's overall macroeconomics. Is it OK then?

I'm asking because I've stopped myself from posting similar in fear of removal.
