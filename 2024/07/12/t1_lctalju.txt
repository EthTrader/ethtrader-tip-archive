They are brainwashing people into thinking that crypto is either a scam or for criminal purposes. The reason why is because the traditional financial system has been controlled by the elite (governments, banks, institutions), ever since the Roman era.

Crypto is basically a parallel economy, where transactions can be made independently, quickly, at a low cost. Crypto gives users full control of their money. Crypto is one of the best way to preserve wealth, and even scale it, especially in an inflationary environment.

Crypto is a direct threat to the traditional financial system, thatâ€™s why they hate it.
