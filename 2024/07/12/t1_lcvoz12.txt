Yes, he told me on Twitter to "stop telling fairy tales" or you know what would happen to me. Then he sold MOON using insider information and acted like a total d\*\*\* and excused himself about he was having a kid coming. I am still waiting for proof about that because until then he is the one telling fairy tales.

I imagine that he kept acting like a total d\*\*\* and Reddit gave justice. I wish him a happy life and also for his imaginary kid.
