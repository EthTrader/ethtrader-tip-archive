Bankers are running the system and the world.  People at the top wont let anything change that. The fact that BlackRock and other big players want to take part in crypto world, tells me narrative that crypto is bad is changing. They cant destroy it, so they want to control it somehow (BlackRock bought majority of mining BTC companies). That is my opinion, i might be wrong lol
