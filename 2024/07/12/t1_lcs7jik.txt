I'm not much a crypto investor but ideally I eventually want a couple, maybe 2 or 3 ETH for the serious long haul and I'm talking to the point where I never sell till old age. My thinking is that it's a better idea to try and find an L2 that I think will make it and for that I'd go ARB, OP and Linea.
