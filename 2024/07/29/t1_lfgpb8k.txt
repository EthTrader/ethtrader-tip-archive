People will start selling before distro so there's your volume ðŸ˜†


Seriously though I've been here nearly a year and there's only been good trade volume once or twice on unrelated days in unrelated circumstances, consistency is not possible when there's so few reasons to buy any.


A year in crypto may as well be a lifetime, if it didn't improve then it probably won't ever unless by accident again or by being automatically dragged up by Eth in a bull run if that ever happens. Here's hoping because I hold a few but so many other projects are gonna do much much more.
