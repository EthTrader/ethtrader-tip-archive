I agree, there are too many rules here but im just talking now about T2V vs upvote reddit system and i think T2V is better esp for posts. 

There were to many manipulations going with upvoting and downvotes, its better know, honestly, you dont need to worry about getting 10 downvotes in 5 min, only thing now you have to worry about is Ray, will he nuke your post lol. Huge shout-out to Ray, he is doing great job 😁

On the other hand, i agree with about other rules here, too much to handle for new people.
