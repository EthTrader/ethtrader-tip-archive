Coingecko has had serious concerns about donut for years, the GT score is 4/10, they hide pools for being quiet. Donut also has token security flaws, and 7 defi factor flaws.


Theyve been displayed on their site for years and nobody seems to care. So don't worry, it doesn't mean anything has changed.
