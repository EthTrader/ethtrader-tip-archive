$10 a day is the norm as well, I remember once the pool on Gnosis got hidden automatically as it had 0 trades and 0 volume in over 24 hours.


Very sobering considering most exchanges want thousands and thousands per day in volume and there seems to be absolutely no way to even move towards that.Â 


Even zooming out to the past year it's a heck of a drop from 3-4 and 6 cents, the volume then may have been higher but it was largely sell pressure so volume needs an asterisk or something.. I'm sure terra luna had *insane* volume when it crashed but that's not the point at all lol, high volume can be a terrible thing circumstantially.


I'm writing 1k words again examining something in depth and I do not know why I do this ðŸ˜†


Good post, info/stats are so much better than just hopium even if the facts are negative I'd rather know than be deluded.Â
