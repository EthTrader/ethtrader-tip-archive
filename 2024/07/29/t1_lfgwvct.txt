I believe that we are not aware and cant even comprehend the insane amount of changes that we are going to witness win the coming 20 years.

I think we have been in a little dip in the last 10 years regarding evolution and having some signs of what is coming next. But now we are going to see the fruits of those signs like electric cars or other kind of transport philosophy, crypto adoption and a lot of use of cases and integrations, AI disrupting everywhere (I totally believe that we will use it for basically everything, not to remove humans but yes to upgrade a lot of jobs).

Regarding crypto as a safer investment, well I believe that will come after regulations but it is going to be really tricky and I have the feeling that they will only allow to create projects, etc to their friends or to people that are under a big scrutinize or meets some criteria and of course pay taxes or the corresponding bribe. Something similar to creating an start up but with more rules.

Anyway, I am really excited about the future and to see what is the next big trend because now that I got into crypto and investment world, I am going to try to jump into the next rocket every time I can. Once an investor, always an investor.
