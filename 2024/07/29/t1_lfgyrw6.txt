Both parties are saying whatever to win some votes but one thing is pretty clear. Crypto is being the center of discussion meaning that crypto is going to keep going and being adopted, regulated, etc.

I dont know much about US elections and for me both parties are not a choice from my liberal European mind (We love orgies here) but they need to fulfill some agreements that they get in the dark when lobbying bribes happen.

My bet is that Trump will win but let see. Anyway, one way or another, crypto is the future.
