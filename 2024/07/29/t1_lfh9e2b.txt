Totally, I see ETH as one and if not the biggest technological ecosystem we will ever seen.

I think BTC can work as store of value and even currency for countries with a shitty one but ETH is something else. Its possibilities are insane and I see it as something equivalent to a huge OS that works for everyone. Nothing seen until now.
