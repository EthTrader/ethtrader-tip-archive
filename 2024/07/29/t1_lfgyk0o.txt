>Tokenization is the process of representing a physical or virtual asset, along with ownership or rights of it into a token. Tokenization means that you get an object, break it apart, and digitize it in such a manner that it becomes possible to invest in it fractionally. It can bring about the segmentation of valuable resources into parts that can be easier to market hence making important resources available to the broader society.
