1m changes it from 5 users to 30 users, it's better but I don't have a great deal of confidence this would change anything. 


Look at how quiet it is now and how many cheaters and spammers there were and still are. I'm reluctant to keep putting faith in change when the changes are lowering engagement, holders, price etc.
