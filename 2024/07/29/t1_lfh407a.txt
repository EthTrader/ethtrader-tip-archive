Unequal vote weight was a deliberate design choice, centralizing power into the hands of individuals. That is true and can't say it wasn't a purposeful choice to follow through with it. 


Like I said, I know why (people had their chances but didn't take it) and that's a seperate issue entirely, but it's not what I said. 


You could very easily have 4 users with that weight, or 5 or 3 or 10 but it matters very little, the point is the whole thing was designed on purpose to bring about this very opportunity, to centralize power into the hands of participants. Again, not a bad thing and I understand why but you 100% see the issues it brings about to allow any small number (2 of 500) to decide anything alone while claiming it's decentralized.
