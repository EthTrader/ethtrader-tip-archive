Most definitely still bullieving in ETH. ETF's have been approved and thats the gateway to a lot more exposure down the track. ETH really is a foundation that can have a LOT of services and tools built upon. I'm keeping hold of my ETH, and staking it to continue to accumulate. The goal is 32 ETH, and then monthly passive income withdrawals for life!

Also, MOON to $1 and DONUT to 2.69c xD
