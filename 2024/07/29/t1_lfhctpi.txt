There are a number of ways users can increase their CONTRIB now; from additional bonuses to governance participation, DONUT Initiatives, and things like Post of the Week... or an y other way that is a valuable contribution to the community, such as the beta testers for the Arbitrum Shuttle.

It seems you've tipped away nearly 2 million DONUT yourself - perhaps if Carl was a little more active on the sub, he too could tip DONUT to quality content - or offer DONUT as a reward for completing certain tasks.

I don't see the need for you guys to outright burn what you have received for your long term contributions to the community and DONUT project - nor do I agree in capping power.
