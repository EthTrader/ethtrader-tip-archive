Definitely a slight nerf on link posts, but i wouldn't restrict them to 1 per day either. Some people definitely tip them without reading them though - one of the worst cases I saw was a a link to a Medium.com blog (user generated content) - and the blog was littered with links to clone websites (wallet drainers)

The post had 7 or 8 tips - but, people will blindly tip who posted stuff, instead of the content itself.
