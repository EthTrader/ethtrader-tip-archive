I think Sushi dragged their heels setting up the rewards on the pool for a while then they were too low. Wish I could remember where I saw it, doesn't matter though!Â 


It is far too risky at that low a return, most people are gonna actually lose money and most of the same people are hoping for volume and price rise which could cause their own losses. It's very conflicting/weird to me.
