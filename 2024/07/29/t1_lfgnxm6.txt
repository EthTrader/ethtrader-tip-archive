Good Question, I do have a slightly more concentrated range.

1 ETH = 120k to 451k DONUT. (For reference it's currently 374k)

Definitely, if the DONUT/ETH ratio continues to remain stable, or if DONUT increases in value relative to ETH, it'll look very nice. If DONUT falls to ETH, it'll just be okay.
