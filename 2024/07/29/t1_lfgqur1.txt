I wonder how many projects use trading bots... If you were a project aiming for a listing, it wouldn't be a bad idea to set up some trading bots, spend a few bucks a day in trading fees and slippage and artificially inflate that volume xD

But yes, this current pool is overall quite inactive and most of the price fluctuations are simply following ETH for the time being, until the next big thing.
