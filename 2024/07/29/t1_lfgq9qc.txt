It's ridiculous how they use all of these arguments against crypto, yet never mention the benefits it brings to everyone? 


Yes, decentralisation does lead to organisations being funded which shouldn't, whose funding will be dangerous, but what about the fact that it brings everyone freedom? Freedom from third parties, giving you the chance you own your own finances?


You only get to hear one side of the story. That's like saying we should do away with freedom of speech, since it leads to unrest.
