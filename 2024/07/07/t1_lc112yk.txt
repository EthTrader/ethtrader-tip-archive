The stats didn't make sense, we had more good bots overall and the same amount of bad bots as the first place, numbers different but the ratio was the exact same. It didn't add up and the maths didn't check out, think it was bugged but it looked like we should have been 1st.


Also most of the bad bot comments were malicious and from non registered users that come in waves and attack
