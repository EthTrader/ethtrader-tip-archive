No voting bonuses this round.

The current governance week proposals conclude in Round 139 - so the voting bonus wouldn't get applied until Round 139 CSV.

There were no governance proposals that concluded in Round 138 - due to the previous governance week being held 1 week earlier than it should have been.

RayRay was a bit premature when he posted the previous governance week 😝
