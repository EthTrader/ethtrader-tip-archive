TBD: I think it's 2 weeks into the first round.

But, I would wager between 0.5 to 0.75

Based on the final round before the sunset, the Karma gained would have resulted in a ratio of 0.33 based on the current reward allocation.

But, I imagine overall karma will be lower now as the farmers moved on xD
