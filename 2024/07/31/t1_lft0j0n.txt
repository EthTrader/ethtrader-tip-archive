As it stands, ASIX and OCEAN tokens on supported exchanges have been converted into FET at pre-set ratios and currently trade under the FET ticker - this will eventually be converted to $ASI

Best thing would be to take a supporting exchange like Binance and buy FET at a comfortable entry point, and let them take care of the conversion.
