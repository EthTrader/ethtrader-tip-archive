Nice this is a step forward for adoption. One of the biggest concerns people have about crypto is safety. I can speak for myself I was always scared and mostly in Defi because one wrong click and its over. But as I learn and educate myself I become more confident so education is another important thing. Fraud, scams, hacks etc are a big barrier to entry and this will help build more trust in the space !tip 1
