Yesterday I watched a podcast with Mike Novogratz and I learned hes literally an Ethereum OG. Hes from the ICO days and sold the bags at $300. I think his entry price was around $1. It was an important lesson because theres no way we can predict things and taking profit is always a good thing. Im going to follow him more closely now definitely an insteresting personality in the space !tip 1
