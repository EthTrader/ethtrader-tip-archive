2 - so as long as the 250 words is the user expanding on the tweet and does not include copy pasting of the tweet itself or fluff/fillet text.

This actually gives it the opportunity to be a discussion post, rather than the equivalent of a re-tweet.

Disagree with 3 - because some credentialed journalists are already expanding on a tweet - assuming their content is not AII generated, shhould gives it a pass.
