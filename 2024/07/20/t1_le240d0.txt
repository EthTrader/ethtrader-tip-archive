Definitely the fine-tuning of rules that align with the vision of the sub are essential, and of course, first there should be a detailed expanded wiki for this sub - similar to that which is r/cc

But, seeing as r/cc already exists, (and this is where having a written mission statement/vision/ideology is important) there no point being a smaller community of general crypto news, but instead r/cryptotrader, is in it's name, really should have a focus on Trading.
