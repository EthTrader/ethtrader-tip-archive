I am reticent about this, as it might create a new farming meta and that’s not something we need. However, I do recognize that crypto news websites write whole articles about tweets all the time.

Twitter is the best source of news in the space, if you ask me. Most of the time users get reliable, quick, unfiltered information.

With that in mind, I don’t see a problem with drafting posts based on tweets. As long as they’re not low-effort, full of generic words to fill the word requirement, and the source is clearly stated in it.

Again, I still think this is going to open room to a new farming meta, so I seriously advise moderators to monitor it closely.
