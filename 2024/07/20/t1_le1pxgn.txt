No new ideas from my part. Empty brain.

A guide could help but not sure why I still have the feeling some sort of "secret" FUD has been placed around all the T2V thing.

I wonder if people flying away because of T2V is more because using tip command is more effort or because it requires giving a DONUT too. Still trying to figure out how to increase the number of real humans here.

We also have to take in count that it is summer and crypto is moving through a desert sentiment that feels like the winter. Anyway, I think end of August and September will be a good time to see if activity rises.
