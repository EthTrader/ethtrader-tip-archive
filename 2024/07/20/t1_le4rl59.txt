I am happily living, and enjoying 

Crypto investment for me is a plus, myself I do t like risks considering I’m relatively new to crypto with those who’s main focus is crypto trading 

I know crypto is a life changer and has been of big success to many people 

But I don’t see crypto investment with a gambling perspective rather than managing your wealth for the long run, considering traditional money is just losing value over time
