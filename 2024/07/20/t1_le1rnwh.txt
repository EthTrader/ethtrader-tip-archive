Damn! What a disgusting view! xD

Yes, I think that is probably what happened.

Regarding creating content, something that bothers me a bit when creating posts is that we can't use Twitter as source to create a post the same way as mainstream media does.

99% of the news links use a Tweet as source and build the article around it but we can share it as News flair. However if I take that same Tweet and build a text post it falls under Media flair.

Options here:

* Links that use a tweet as source must be flaired as Media
* Nerf News flair to the same as Media
* Allow creating text posts using a tweet as source and flair it as News
* Do nothing

I dont know why I have the feeling that since the day that rule was brought back the amount of external interaction reduced a lot.  
Just brainstorming and sharing how I felt it based on my own experience.
