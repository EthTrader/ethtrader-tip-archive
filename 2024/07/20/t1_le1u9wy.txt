mmh I'm not that sure.

besides, engaging often in those subs, I often had the impression they think of this place like a huge and distant entity from the RCC environment that they are even scared.

I see all the same faces across all those subs, but here...

OFC what makes them engage with those subs is the love for avatars, that's the reason why those subs exist in the first place, but I can tell they are often "scared" or disinterested to join here

so could make sense to try and do something that put us closer to them, not sure I explained myself ðŸ˜…
