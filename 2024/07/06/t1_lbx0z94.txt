No, I wouldn't consider doing it for free and even those ones with high apy are risks for volatility. I think a bit like the wider crypto market it's fine or profitable for about half the people who get propped up and enabled by the other half make losses doing things like LP for no apy.


Very similar to the RCP market, total marketcap stays the same but loads of new tokens, meaning that the money is just being spread across and traded between a similar sized community of the same people.Â
