Oh I get. Mods tends to ban users that weren't participating in the sub before Kraken listing. But I agrees. Fortnite mods sold before Reddit sunset news and no one actually talk anything about them because most people in the sub doesn't even understand what bricks are. I wish kraken can delist it as well tbh. !tip 1
