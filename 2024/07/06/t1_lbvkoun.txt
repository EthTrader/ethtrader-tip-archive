I sold in 3 stages. First time at like 0.07 a week before they got listed. Stupid decision.
Then I DCAed out but I forgot to setup sell orders so didn't sell any above 0.55

Then I panic sold at 0.11 during ruggit.
I kept around 2K which I sold at 0.40 during the pump when they anno they're coming back.
Brought back some more during the drop since then, I think I'm on track to earn a couple of 100 this month. What about you?
