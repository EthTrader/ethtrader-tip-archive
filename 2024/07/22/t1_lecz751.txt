Good point, honestly. But Arbitrum is still the leading Layer 2 solution, and I doubt that will change any time soon.

Other options would be Chainlink, because it’s pioneering tokenization, or Base. If Base launched a coin, it would easily become a top 50. Though, I don’t think they’re interested in that.
