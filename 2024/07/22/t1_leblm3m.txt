Sometimes you just gotta dive into the deep end and figure out how to swim.

Many users here complain about r/cc having too many rules; but, not having any rules is what left this place be blanketed with 5000 comments a day of tip spam and digs of letters.

If we actually want to live to our name "EthTrader" - we really do need to incorporate some of the content standard rules similar to those defined in the r/cc expanded rules wiki.

It might be met with some resistance at first, but overall it reduces how much low quality content gets produced.
