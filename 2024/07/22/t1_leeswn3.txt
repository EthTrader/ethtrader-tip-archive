I know many people have been scammed using Discord. When I signed up there years ago (besides it's horribly difficult to use and hideous interface) it was full of scammers contacting me all the time and everywhere on the app. After 3-4 days I decided never to touch it again.

How come you can't stop this? Security there is awfully low.
