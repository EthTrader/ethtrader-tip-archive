One of my posts got
Deleted because another post was posted 5 days before 

I know, it’s pain in the A** to find new articles but also keep repeating similar news doesn’t look professional 

I suggest a better solution, a 3 hrs cooldown between 2 posts 

So if you post at 8am next post must be by 11am only
