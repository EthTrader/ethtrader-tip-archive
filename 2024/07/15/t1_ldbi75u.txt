Even then, I'd maintain duplicate post is a duplicate post.

That doesn't mean it's a duplicate topic though.

If after 3 days, theres actually new information, then it's a new story, therefore not a duplicate.

But, if the article is still presenting the same information as previously published, it's still a duplicate. 

Content standards should be met that we are posting up to date information.
