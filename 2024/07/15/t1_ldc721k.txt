I see where you’re coming from but with 12 hours it would become a lot of duplicates…

I do, however, think there should be some sort of time cap… Once I had a post removed because the post was apparently already posted (another source) like 17 days ago. I did search the sub but at some point you might stop scrolling… I will vote [NO] but would maybe say [YES] to a longer time frame, but I think it would need to be significantly longer for me to vote for it
