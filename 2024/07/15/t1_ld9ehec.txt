Ethereum basically pioneered Web 3 and the entire DeFi space. I wouldn’t say it’s undervalued, everyone involved in crypto understands and respects ethereum.

The only thing here is the lack of visibility and recognition in the average person’s eyes, especially the normies who don’t understand DeFi. Maybe that will change with global adoption, and tokenization might help in that regard (which is also being pioneered by ethereum).
