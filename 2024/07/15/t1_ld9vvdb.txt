Definitely phase 2.

Smart money was accumulating all of 2023 - which you could see buy the BTC dominance slowly increasing and BTC slowly rising.

We've had the pre-halving pump, which, kinda is a trap, as the correction afterwards has come right on time. Smart money is once again, continuing to accumulate.

We definitely have not seen peak Euphoria yet.

This is a good time to continue accummulating.
