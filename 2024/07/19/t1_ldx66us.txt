if people are complaining about the price of DONUT, and they're selling, it's not shaming... it's calling them out xD

Also, because of the nature of this particular crypto, anyone who's selling, and also complaining about the rules of  the sub, or "overpowered mods" should get called out too.

For example, the proposal to Nerf the daily links down to 0.1x multiplier only passed by 20k donuts.

However, I calculated 20 users who voted NO had sold nearly 1 million worth of governance power - if they complain about the rules then yes, call them out because they sold their governance power.
