>Maybe it's just in the heads of the sellers themselves.

nah, this isn't it 😁

I have personally be harassed lately for having sold donuts.

Not just me, you can see every day many people saying seller are paper hands and similar stuff. this is part of the culture I'm talking about.

this is real money, people should manage them how is best for their own strategy, and it's their business only, imo.
