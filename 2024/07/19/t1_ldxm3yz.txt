Im really scared cause of inflation. The cost of living will rise and people like me, who lives paycheck to paycheck wont be able to afford to invest. For wealthy people, rate cuts are ideal scenario tho and they move the market.

So Wealthier peopleÂ benefit from inflation, while the working class bears the costs.
