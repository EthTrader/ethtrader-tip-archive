>I have read a lot of bad reviews about this exchange.

Even Binance which I so far consider the best safest has horrible reviews on TrustPilot and PlayStore. Don't let them deter you. Champion personal experience and spread your funds across multiple exchanges as we approach the bull run because arbitrary asset freezing will be a thing like in 2021.
