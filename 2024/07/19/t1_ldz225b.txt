The most decentralized coin continues to be bitcoin. There is no one behind it and that was the real purpose of crypto.

Look at the market today...Btc is going up and everyone is following.

Ethereum has a long way to go, but it won't replace Bitcoin.

And it is not necessary, they can complement each other.

I love Eth and its utility, but these are the facts and we have to be realistic!
