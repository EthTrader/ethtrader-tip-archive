i explained myself poorly I thinkðŸ™ƒ

I'm absolutely ok with what you did, I'm just saying that selling 10k donuts each distro is probably even better than selling 2millions in one tx, at least I think it is for the ones who keeps shaming the sellers.

for me it's the nature of this market, people buy and sell, we are all here for this and we all behave according to our strategy
