Exactly. This is how the traditional financial system was designed. To benefit those who have and control the money, while harming those who need it most.

The system is not fair, but it is balanced. What I mean by this is that for someone to live comfortably, with several mansions, yachts, super cars and helicopters, someone else has to get up every day at 6 am to go to work, to be able to put food on the table (plus bills, mortgage, etc).

The working class will always have to exist. Despite being the pillar of the traditional financial system, it is the one that suffers the most at its expense.
