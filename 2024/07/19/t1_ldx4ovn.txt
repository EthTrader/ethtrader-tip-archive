Sure, crypto is crypto, and people are allowed to do what they want with them.

Shaming a seller isn't cool - however, I will happily call people out who do sell, if they are also the ones who are complaining about price action. Or asking how to increase value.

As I have in the past, when a user spent 90% of their comments asking "how can we make price go up?" despite having a hidden flair and they sell every single one of their donuts every round. Then yes, the answer is, stop selling you moron.
