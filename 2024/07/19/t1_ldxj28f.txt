We can’t compare traditional money earned from job to which Donuts earned by farming or any other Rcp 

We all know money is just being printed and literally have no back up it the influence 

Donuts to raise, we need investors, and investors won’t jump in if they check sells are more than buys 

And for sure everyone is here to earn and make some gains at some point, but helping donuts boost first is a great decision
