Very true and valid point!

We start saying here in the sub paperhands who sells.

*In actual Paperhands means -- Sell in a panic wen prices drop.*

It's not fair to say paperhand what you earn for free and sell it. In the end, we all have to sell at some point, so it means we all will be paperhand.
