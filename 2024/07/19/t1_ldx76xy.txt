We all earn donut for free and no matter how we look at it, it's free money and we'll eventually sell one day. No matter how you hodl, how many you hodl, when the price eventually goes up, you sell.

Some people might have financial issues irl, while some just wants to swap donut to HODL something better(like bitcoin or Ethereum), some might even add it up to their monthly salary as it might help them financially. We don't know what anyone is facing irl, we are all just anonymous on Reddit trying to make something and gaining knowledge along the way.

People who shame sellers will eventually dump it one day and that's no lie. They're so many mods who have sold more than 80% of their donut bags, they may have swapped it for ETH or do something with it IRL(like I said before, no one knows what anyone are facing IRL). So you can't expect everyone to be like you. Some are cool with some hundreds bucks, some are okay with thousands bucks. Everyone has what they're pursuing in life. Our goals all can't be the same. So I think people are free to do with whatever they want to do with their donuts. 
 Selling shaming doesn't make sense because one day, even YOU that shame others will eventually sell you bags. !tip 1
