Same as some others have said I don't think anybody should be shamed for selling people can do what they want! 

With that said I agree with the great Austrian shitnut that being called out for selling when complaining all the time is different to being shamed for selling.

Personally I just leave every bitching and whining to it now. CBA getting involved in that shit. Outsiders would be surprised there are actually fully grown adults behind these profiles.
