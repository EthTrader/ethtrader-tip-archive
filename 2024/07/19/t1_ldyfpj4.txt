The golden age of airdrops is over, although there's still a chance for decent gains from a few that are left like Scroll, Linea and new ones like Monad/maybe Berachain.

I said it a couple of times before - 80% of the battle was being early, which is why last year was the best time to get started and I always urged people to get in early when I was active in making posts here late 2023/early 2024

Same logic lies in crypto - if you want to make exponential gains, you must be there before the rest. Now with airdrops you are just 'there' with anyone else unless something is very early and underfarmed.
