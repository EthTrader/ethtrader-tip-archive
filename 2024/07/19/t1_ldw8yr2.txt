Difference of merely few seconds is just a bad day I guess. I have seen it happen many times before.

Few of my posts had to removed as other user had blocked me and couldn't find it in search. Its just bad luck sometimes.

DBRiMatt has made a new proposal to cancel out Pay2Post for such events if user itself deletes it. If it gets passed we may see some relief in coming distributions.
