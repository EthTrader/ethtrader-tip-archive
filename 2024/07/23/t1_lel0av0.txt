Think of it like this:

* Bitcoin’s purpose is to store value / preserve wealth.

* Ether’s purpose is to provide passive income. This happens via staking / yield farming / LPs. 

I will add that Ethereum is already pioneering tokenization and real world assets. The largest institutions in the world are already investing in tokenization.

Soon enough the blockchain will be incorporated into every business model. Those who don’t do it, will eventually fall behind.

Regarding the ETFs, I knew they were overhyped. It’s always like this. It’ll be different once staking is incorporated into them, because that’s what attracts smart investors: the possibility of creating passive income and diversifying.
