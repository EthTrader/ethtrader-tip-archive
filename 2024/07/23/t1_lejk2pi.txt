The new rules forced us to do this. How else to earn donuts?

Now we don't have people with multiple accounts (do we?) to downvote all day. Instead, we established an unspoken agreement between perhaps the 50 most active users to exchange tips. I feel obligated to respond and tip anyone who interacts with me, even if it's 0 donuts. Sorry if I inadvertently left anyone out.

Yes, it's centralized and puts off newbies, I've said it many times.

Also, comedy, which requires a lot of work and mental effort, should be rewarded in the same way as publications.
