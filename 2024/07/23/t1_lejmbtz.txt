How are you going to establish if they are tipping someone because they've been tipped? 

For example when I go on posts I'll normally go down in order of new and tip pretty much every post. How would that tell you if I'm tipping someone because they've tipped me?

When I have a conversation with someone on a post or on here we tip each other because the tip is the upvote. Just like we did before T2V but back then it was with an actual upvote.
