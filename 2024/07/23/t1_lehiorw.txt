I was about to post about this. Market sentiment seems bad. ETFs are sparkling little interest but we did see a surge from when it dropped to $2900. Maybe that's all we get. 

Bitcoin also had a sluggish start when it's ETF dropped too. Actually dropping in price before it pumped a week later so ETH might experience a delayed pump also.
