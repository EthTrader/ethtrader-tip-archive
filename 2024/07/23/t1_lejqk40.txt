>Also, i saw a post where a user pointed out how the tipping is now a game of popularity and new users aren't getting enough tips

Fr that's one problem too. Some people target new users to be an alts but the truth is, they might and they might not. Which makes only few people tip em. And some might be afraid of their governance weight too but if we genuinely love a post or comments. Tipping em shouldn't be a problem, no matter their govt weight or not. !tip 1
