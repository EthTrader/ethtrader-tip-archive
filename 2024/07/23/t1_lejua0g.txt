I have to agree. Competition is essential as it keeps everyone in check, making everyone improve and provide better user experiences to stay relevant.

However, too much competition can be a bad thing, especially if the demand doesn’t match the abundance of offerings. Look at memecoins for example. The market is so saturated that even promising new (meme) projects struggle to gain traction, because they are just another one among thousands.

Too much offer doesn’t benefit the industry as a whole, imo.
