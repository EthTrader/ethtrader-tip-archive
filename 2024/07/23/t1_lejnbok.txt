Biggest concern with this is resulting in a meta where people ask questions just for the sake of it, "hey guys whats your favourite CEX?" "Whats your favourite L2?"

Will probably find it becomes a Q&A rather than a discussion. Obviously people can still discuss in comment chains and not get rewarded though, but... we'll see how  often that happens
