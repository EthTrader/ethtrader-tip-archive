i agree on the original memes thing, but I guess it would be hard to moderate right?

I mean, sometimes it's very hard to detect am original content when it comes to meme ðŸ¤”

maybe with some rules like 1 comedy post per day, per user, we could avoid too many of them posted?

I don't know, just thinking out loud...

that insane traffic of not registered users feels wasted sometimes
