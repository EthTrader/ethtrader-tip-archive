I'll repeat what I've said several times over the year, one of the issues is a lack of defined expanded rules and guidelines.

It's all good and well to have rules in place, and theres no problem in being strict with them, but they need to be established, defined and easily referred to as to reduce as much confusion and ambiguity as possible.
