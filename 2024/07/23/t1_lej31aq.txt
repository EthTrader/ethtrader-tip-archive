Whilst I do agree, there are some benefits to holding on a CEX, but obviously comes with risk as well.

Tokens which are only on Ethereum Mainnet, you might actually prefer to hold and trade on a CEX and cop the CEX fees instead of native gas fees.

Or, you might be working with small amount it's not even worth transferring out of the CEX.

Theres a time and place for both
