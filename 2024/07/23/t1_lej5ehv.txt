ETFs are a good thing for eth for a few reasons:

1. They allow investors to gain exposure to eth,  without holding it directly.

2. It will bring capital inflows into Ethereum (the network and the coin). 

3. If staking gets incorporated, investors will benefit from passive income. This will attract even more capital into the ecosystem.
