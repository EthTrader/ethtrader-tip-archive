>Yes, it's centralized and puts off newbies, I've said it many times.

Today, a user Mayusuff (can't spell his username right) asked the daily why he wasn't getting replies to his posts and comments and I had to explain to him that his zero voting weight is a put-off. Even unregistered users posts are ignored like plagues. I had to spam tips last round (when i had 0.005 weight) to earn sympathy tips that became a measly 3k donuts. The inclination to treat folks under 20k as lepers is high. I hope mods look into this.
