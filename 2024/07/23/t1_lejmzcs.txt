For me, normally I tip every comment/post I respond to. And after using T2V for almost 50 days now, it seems like my brain is doing that automatically.  
Also, i saw a post where a user pointed out how the tipping is now a game of popularity and new users aren't getting enough tips, so i just decided to tip all the users who hold lesser donuts to create some ease.

^(!tip 1.01)
