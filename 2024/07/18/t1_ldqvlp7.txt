Not heavily farming anything hahaha! I just wanted more ETH to deposit into Symbiotic. I don't know if caps are full at the moment and and also don't want to deposit it straight into Etherfi's vault before checking other options such as Puffer and Mellow. I'll probably just use this moment to some SOL/USDC liquidity farm until I can put it somewhere else
