\[YES\] for this proposal.

I hate this AI rule proposal that went through. One of my post also got deleted due >75% AI. 

I don´t know any tool to use to detect AI and I find it very annoying to do everytime before I post. Also check for plagiates, double post and so on. It´s really annoying and doesn´t make fun anymore to post...

But your proposal may help a bit.
