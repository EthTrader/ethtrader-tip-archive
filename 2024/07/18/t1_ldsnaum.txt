Thanks for your feedback. 

Problem 1 can be solved by only having a short time frame, such as 2 or 3 hours.

But problem 2 is extremely valid. So I'm glad one of the devs has provided this inisght  - a shame if it's not a feasible implementation

Ultimately 50 donuts, or whatever the pay2post fee really isn't that big of a deal, but some users make it seems like the end of the world
