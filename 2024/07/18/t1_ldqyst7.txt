\[YES\] I think this is a good idea in all aspects. I think the 6 hours time frame should be enough.

I am pretty sure that most of the posters will feel related to this steps:

1. Use search tool to find key words from the article. Reddit doesn't show anything.
2. Proceeds to share the link.
3. Scrolls the feed and detects a similar post.
4.  D'oh!

I also believe that encouraging self automoderation is a good initiative and "recovering" the DONUT "lost" is enough reward for it. In fact if losing 1 post is not enough "punishment" we could even reduce to half the amount of fee recovered from the mistake.
