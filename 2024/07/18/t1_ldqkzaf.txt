A DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) that computers use to identify each other on the internet. It functions like a phone book for the internet, enabling users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numeric IP addresses.
