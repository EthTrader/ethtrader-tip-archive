Here's my little feedback;  
>If a user uses the AutoModRemove command on their own post, within 48 hours, that post does not incur the Pay2Post penalty.

I’d prefer it to be 6-12 hours as it will help keep the feed clean. From personal experience, most users know that the link is a duplicate or AI-generated but still leave it hanging, hoping that the mods will miss it. So keeping a shorter timeframe makes sense.

Secondly, I’ve nuked a few of my own posts this round and would like a refund please.
