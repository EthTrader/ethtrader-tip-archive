\[YES\] You proved to be a great candidate for the position.

We need to find a better way to manage the voting period. We need to make it more visible and static. I hope Reddit releases the 6 pinned posts soon because that would help a lot in the process. With that post we could even create or adjust a command to vote based on number. For example !vote \[number\] to choose which one you want to vote, etc.

However until then the current way is better.

I will also try to focus on creating more engagement and participation, even thought I like earning DONUT, I like competence and fun.
