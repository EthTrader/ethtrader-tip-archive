The pilot contests were bound by some methods, such as a huge prize pool and the voting system.

With more flexibility and smaller prize pools there is the option to run easier contests for smaller prizes, and harder contests for larger prizes. 

With 25k prize pool, i was never going to let it be as simple as "create a gif" or "create an emoji" - but for 1k DONUT, that would be more suitable
