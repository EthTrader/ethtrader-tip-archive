I remember the last protest during the COVID time. It trend on twitter then along with Iran protesting for killing a girl for not wearing her hijab. Nigerians protesters were k!lled if I remember correctly and that makes so many leaders like Hillary Clinton and even then twitter CEO Jack Dowsey makes comments about it. I don't think Nigerians will ever protest again due to how they say their government are. !tip 1
