ok ty, i laterally spend 1 to 1.5 hour before posting any post because i only post what i find it interesting and wanna read it myself + to make sure it hasn't been published before and doesn't break the above rules, i've followed the posting rules for months with facing any problems, but in last 5 days 3 posts that have always been eligible to be posted got removed 2 of them in the last 5 hours.
