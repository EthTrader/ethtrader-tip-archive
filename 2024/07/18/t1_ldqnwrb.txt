I agree a shorter time frame is better - this puts the onus on the user for self-moderation.

I suppose in particular, the thing to really eliminate is the unfortunate cases of people posting the same stories within minutes of each other.

I have accidently posted a duplicate myself, and removed it within 1 hour of posting.

If you had to set 1 time-frame, what would it be? 6 hours?

Thanks for the feedback
