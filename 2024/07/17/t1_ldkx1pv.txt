>In the end it is similar to r/ cc where we had 7M members & 7k users in the distribution file. Maybe the ratio is even worse here

correct. the difference is that that one is a general crypto sub, so it's easier starting discussion, because there are so many topics that can be discussed.

this one is a eth sub instead, so the topics are way less, hence a bit more difficult starting discussion...

at least that's how I imagine things to be ðŸ™ƒ

also, my vision of things might be biased by a few bad experiences I had in this sub for which now I'm only interested in donut farming ðŸ™ƒ
