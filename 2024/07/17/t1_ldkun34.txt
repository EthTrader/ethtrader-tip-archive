Oh wow. It makes sense. Thanks for explaining the math of it. 

Yeah the link to news articles type posts have always "confused" me. I would prefer if link posts did not exist. Instead people should write about the content of the link (at least a few sentences) & add it as source. The copy header copy link type deal is spammy. Posters may not even have read the article.
