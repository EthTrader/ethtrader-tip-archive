Goldy already told you almost everything :)

let me add that posting in this sub has a cost, the pay2post fee, that is equal to 2.5x the previous round posts ratio. So we are looking at 100 donuts I think for posting here.

You don't earn donuts with upvotes here, but only with tips, since the sub has introcuded a tip2vote system

a lots of rules, I know ðŸ™ƒ
