I wish I got to know about reddit crypto earlier... I got invited to NFTs when a friend narrated a pfp NFT called MEKAVERSE on how he gained money from it, so I got hyped and was also looking for whitelist new project. All the whitelist I got and minted was later rugged until I gave up on the NFTs ideas lol. And the MEKAVERSE he told me about later got called out and price went downhill. So we were both fvcked though !tip 1
