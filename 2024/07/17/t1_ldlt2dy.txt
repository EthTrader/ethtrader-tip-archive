>We often blame the top two whales for having a higher weight but rarely try to start accumulating more governance weight ourselves. This is something we need to work on. No more firing blank shots.

You know, the big one... not selling is how you keep your governance power. There are hundreds of thousands of reduced governance power from just a handful of currently active users - and that's AFTER so many recent users have been banned for being alts or become inactive in recent months.

Most of the people complaining "the big 2" have too much governance power are the ones who are selling.

From memory of the users who voted NO to nerf the News Links, there was close to 1 million sold donuts, relative to earned CONTRIB.


That said, there are recent changes to help increase CONTRIB, ranging from participation in governance proposals, the Initiatives to award CONTRIB to Shuttle Beta Testers, CONTRIB for the pilot season of the Contests, and now Post of the Week.
