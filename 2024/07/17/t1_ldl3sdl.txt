I’m not sure how to improve it but I do have a major gripe… It’s regarding tip weights.

I dislike the fact that I (who is hodling) am handing out full weight tips to people that keep dumping their donuts. What do I get in return from these? I get a mediocre 0 weight or maybe a 0.1 weight tip back. Basically I’m feeding their money machine, meanwhile I’m the one getting ”punished” with a shitty weight back from them.

I’ve never sold a donut, don’t get me wrong I might do that one day if the time comes, but I’m more or less getting penalized by hodling… When truly I should be the one getting full weight tips and, in return, hand out 0 weight tips to the people who keep selling.

For the record, I have never been against selling. In fact I dislike sell shamers. But it leaves a sour taste in my mouth when a few regulars keep handing me 0 weight tips when I hand them 1 weight tips, and they keep selling and repeat.
