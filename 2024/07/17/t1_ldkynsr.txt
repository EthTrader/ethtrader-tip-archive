Love that mindset Rik!!!

There’s 0 need to talk to anyone about it, I agree. I me tion some small things to my family but it’s natural- we are a very open family and we all are close.

I never give any details though when they start asking about specifics. I’ll just sometimes mention that I took profit or something and bought this and that with it.
