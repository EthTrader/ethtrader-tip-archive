Didn't know that posting here was that "expensive". Experience is priceless but my recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1e4au57/the_first_donuts_have_just_been_rewarded_to/) likely cost more than it earned at this rate.

I guess that keeps a lot of low effort content out which is a great thing. Posters really must be confident in their content before they post.
