When an economy completely stops working, as was the case during COVID-19, it will take years for a full recovery to happen. the recovery process is inevitably prolonged and very slow as well. First, the economy must get back what it lost during the period of inactivity. This involves restoring jobs, resuming business operations, etc.

There were disruptions to supply chains, drastic changes in consumer behavior, and financial strains on both households and businesses. This naturally makes recovery a lot harder.

Once the lost ground is regained, the economy then has to return to its pre-crisis growth trajectory. This is the second phase.

This second phase needs rebuilding confidence among consumers and investors, stabilizing financial markets, and fixing any structural changes caused by the pandemic.

Don’t forget about the stimulus checks and all the financial supports that the government provided. These were not financial aids or “free money”, they were LOANS. Loans that are being paid off now. Even though these measures were necessary to prevent a deeper recession, they have also resulted in more public debt and inflation.
