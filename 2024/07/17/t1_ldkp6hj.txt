I'll admit that I did lose hope on donuts but well before the price hit 0.006, for me it was right around the T2V drama.

Saying that, donuts at 0.006 is an easy ticket to make profit, if I had some spare money I would have loaded up to the max. Unfortunately I took my big gamble on donuts before it crashed to this price.
