Not in this particular case. Here, the $1.2 billion settlement mainly involves paying fines and penalties to the CFTC.

Supposedly, there are provisions for refunding the customers, so they would receive payments too. Though, the details of who specifically will get paid and the exact distribution of the settlement amount is yet to be determined (I think?).
