Refinement is the word I'd say

Improve Small things 1 by 1 so we get ourselves set up for the influx of newcomers in the real bull run (most probably 2025)

2 I'd say: 1) Improve the moderating of posts, too many nuking sprees going on and 2) Improve the 5/5 mod signature, too many delays going on every single round - maybe get another guy in since it keeps getting stuck at 4/5
