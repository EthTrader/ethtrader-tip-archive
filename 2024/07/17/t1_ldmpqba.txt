It's a good discussion to have! I just don't think this is a solution that will work. But with brainstorming, criticism and feedback, it could lead to an inspired idea which might work.

It helps when users say why they are against an idea, rather than just bluntly rejecting it.

Even though we can't eliminate all flaws, we can potentially reduce them, or atleast steer the direction into a sub and community that meets with our vision. 

I for one like to see rewards and rules that help encourage quality content, inspired discussion and a range of content as I believe that is what attracts a healthy organic growth of new users.
