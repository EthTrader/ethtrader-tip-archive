Good points!

Strongly agree with the learning curve. It seems like newcomers are very frustrated…

Maybe some sort of hand book or quickguide sheet would be good… Say, everytime I come across a newcomer I could paste this sheet of TLDR information.

I feel like I don’t know where to begin explaining the most important stuff to a newcomer atm
