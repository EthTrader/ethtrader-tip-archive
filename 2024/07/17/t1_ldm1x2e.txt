I'd even suggest 25% - and have a minimum threshold of say, 25 tips - because otherwise, there might be unfair penalties applied to infrequent users.

I would also say, categorise posts and comments seperately.

EG. If I tip 100 posts, but 26 tips are to the same poster, that's probably worth looking into.

However, if I only tip 20 posts, and 10 are to the same poster - well, that's not a huge impact. 

Same for comments, if I tip 1000 comments, and 251 are to the same user, that's probably questionable. 

End of the day, there are more than enough active users for legitimate tipping to not account for more than 1 quarter of somebodies tips - and the more active a user is, the more tips should be spread. (Hence, a little leniency, on less than 25 tips)

Just my expansion of the idea - whether it's feasible or not.
