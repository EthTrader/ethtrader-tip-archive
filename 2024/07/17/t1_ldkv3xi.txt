>Posters may not even have read the article.

that's right, I read half of the posts I share, maybe even less ðŸ‘€

the thing you say about people writing about the content of those links is absolutely right, and it would be even greater if other people would start discussions and all....

but don't be fooled by the 2.5 million users joining this sub... the truth is there only is a bunch of active users in here (like 20 super active ones and 200 less active ones) and the purpose of being here is donut farming, so discussions aren't that common since they take time and are less profitable in terms of donut earnings ðŸ™ƒ

you can have a better idea of the active users numbers by looking at the monthly distribution CSV if you are interested
