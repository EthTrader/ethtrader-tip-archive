btc chain is the most secure & with it's limited 21m supply -will b priced high as long as demand is high & there know reason for demand to go down as btc is considered the digital gold, on the other hand eth has more use cases but with it's open supply even f demand goes higher price wouldn't b able to go close to btc level to surpass it n market cap and f supply increased to increase market cap price will drop & higher market cap won't b achieved, only possible way is by limiting supply to the current level for years or even burning more & reducing to a lower level & this must b combined by a greater demand compared to btc like triple 4example, i can't c any of this happening as eth needs the relatively high supply to support all projects buit on it's chain, we don't know what eth developers can do about all this so only time will tell
