I think the biggest problem T2V has is the "learning curve" for outsiders and that it feels like an insiders tool but I like how the health of karma instantly was recovered.

However I still believe we need to work on some things:

1. Make T2V easier (no clue about this and if it is even possible with Reddit tying our hands) 
2. Find ways to make the sub more fun and attractive to outsiders so they stay here and engage more. (Still no clue on how to do this without chaos xD)
