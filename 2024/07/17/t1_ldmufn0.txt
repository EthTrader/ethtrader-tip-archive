Diversify is my suggestion!

Whatever your comfort thresholds are; for sake of Argument, lets say you have 10 ETH. 

You might want 6 ETH in cold storage, safe and secure. No worries, no stress!

You might keep 1 ETH on Binance staking

You might keep 1 ETH on Coinbase

Stake 1 ETH with LIDO - Hot Wallet #1

Stake 1 ETH with Rocketpool - Hot Wallet #2

If something happens you at worst, will lose 1 ETH, which sounds like a lot. but is only 10%.

Theoretically, that still can seem risky. And ETH staking is around a 3% average APY.

But, IMO, diversification is a way to mitigate risks and hopefully help build your position.
