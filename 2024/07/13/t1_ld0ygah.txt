You and me both, lol. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ConeHeads/comments/1e28bmj/comment/lcz6ueo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConeHeads/comments/1e28bmj/comment/lcz6ueo/)

The avatars never really excited me. But the tokens, I think with a bit of luck & dedication the RCC team can turn them into something really cool.

I'm keen to get back into some governance debate. I used to be an involved member in r/CryptoCurrencyMeta but then it was no more for a while and I had to focus on rl a bit. Now I miss talking & thinking about development in the crypto space.

I'm not making promises but I think you might see me more often here in the coming weeks & months. :D
