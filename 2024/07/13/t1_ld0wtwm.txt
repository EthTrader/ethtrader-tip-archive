It’s like this, 

If you have a spare amount which is not needed sometime soon m, you can use to invest, while if you have a certain amount and you have debts to clear on time and things didn’t work well accordingly, you’ll have to sell off even at loss to cover 

That’s the difference, patience is the key 

Look at all those early investors who bought BTC / ETH and managed somehow to wait years, those were definitely not in urgent need of that invested money
