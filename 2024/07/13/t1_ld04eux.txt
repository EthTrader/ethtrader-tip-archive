Yeah you can't buy it what I mean is it doesn't make sense that someone can sell all their donuts and get a full weighted vote from me yet I'm the one who gets penalised if they upvote me back.

I wouldn't call it tipping rings. We are all interacting with each other and had it not been for T2V we would be upvoting each other anyway, mostly. Every time I interact with someone I'm going to upvote them. Say me and you started conversing nearly daily on the sub because we are both so active then you will see us tipping each other constantly because that's how we upvote.

Just think of a post on r/stellarcannacoin everyone is upvoting each other but it doesn't mean it's a ring. Just looks different because the origin of the upvotes aren't public. 

If there was a small group of users exclusively tipping each other then the manipulation will be spotted and they will get banned. Any of us can check that as well. I could just go on someone's profile and see for myself.

Whoever said there are tipping rings ask them for an example and go look at the profile of the user they give you!
