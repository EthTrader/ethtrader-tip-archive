Ethereum will surprise many people. People around the world are buying cheap coins in hopes of getting rich quick.

Eth is still available and very undervalued. In a few years the average person won't be able to afford 1 whole Eth. As is happening now with Bitcoin. Also, Eth/Btc will not have the necessary liquidity for so many buyers.
