It's good to be in a sub with healthy voting habits. Negative voting balances discourage minority opinions and turn the conversation into echo chambers. People with opposing views no longer participate. We need spaces where every opinion is valid, right?!

I'm glad you're still around. Is Ethtrader "home" now for you?
