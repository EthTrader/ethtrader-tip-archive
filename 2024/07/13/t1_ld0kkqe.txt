Quality over quantity.

Even though we have Pay2post, it's pretty easily covered.

Low quality links get downvoted in r/cc - and general questions often get removed and redirected to their daily.

This leaves their front page with a healthier balance of a range of higher quality posts and important news topics.

More content doesn't always mean better content.
