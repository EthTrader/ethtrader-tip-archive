Donut is high at the top of the totem poll and we'd be lying to ourselves if we said it wasn't!

In terms of Donut culture I guess we have a culture of returning upvotes but that's just Reddit in general really. We have to tip to give an upvote that will count for distribution of Donuts.

We have tip 2 upvote here so the usual Reddit upvote means nothing in terms of earning donuts but we still need to do normal upvotes so the sub gets traction
