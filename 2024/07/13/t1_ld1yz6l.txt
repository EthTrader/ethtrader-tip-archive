well the $1T part is obviously unrealistic, since btc already reached that mark only eth is able to reach it anytime soon, not even BNB or solana so certainly not shiba. but on the other hand the effort made by shiba inu's community to transform it into a mainstream token is promising "making partnerships with many firms to be used as a payment method + building dapps starting with their 1st p2e game + making the shibarium L2 network + the burning mechanism that can develop into a more sharp & efficient one"
