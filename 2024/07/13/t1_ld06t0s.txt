Sorry. Use the AI detector to check articles before you post. Just copy about 100 words from the article you want to post and paste on https://quillbot.com/. It will let you know if it's written by AI.

Also, you might wanna stop using coinmarketcap articles cos they're not allowed. Same with coinstats. Use the direct link or you might have your post removed.
