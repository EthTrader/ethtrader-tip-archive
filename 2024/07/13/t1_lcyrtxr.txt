Depends on the context I guess. If we know the reason why someone was banned and know it was bullshit and they shouldn't have been banned I'd have no problem with it.

If we don't know why someone was banned then we should try and find out the reason. If we know why someone was banned and it was genuine rule violation etc then they probably shouldn't be allowed back depending on the severity of what they did.

I don't think it's really a black and white issue ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›
