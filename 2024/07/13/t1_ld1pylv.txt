unfortunately i think the sub is nearly dead, 99.99nine% of new members won't stay more than 5-6 weeks at max, i really wonder why mods r inactive i mean f someone accepted 2 b a mod shouldn't he/she have the time 4 that, "elitarian society" "interesting description", i remember the 1st time i read about this place & really had high expectations, unfortunately expectations now not far from the floor
