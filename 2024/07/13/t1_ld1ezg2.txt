I really dislike that guy tbh and don't take his arguments seriously because of the personal attacks and the way he presents them. 

I hope we can have respectful talks and find better ways forward always but I'm personally not unhappy with tip2vote if that's what you mean. The vote manipulation before was just too ugly imo. !tip 1
