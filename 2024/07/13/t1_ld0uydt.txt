Not rugged. But defs the moons liquidity pool...

I was the 4th largest provider there, and lost about 5 eth as the price of moon tanked

Sadly. The panic made me withdraw my position, which became about 250k moons... and then I sold all those at 3.5c

If I had either kept the position, or even just held the moons, I'd have been laughing now. But. That was a new experience, didn't know moons could live on and in fact be a better crypto ðŸ¤£
