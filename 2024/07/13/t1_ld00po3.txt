It's a right faff actually doing it for starters. Remembering to tip everyone is getting exhausting haha 

It's harder for new users to understand and get their head around. HODLers get no benefit from it. For example you'll get a full weighted upvote from me but let's say you'd earned 100k donuts and sold them all I would get an upvote with the weight of zero if you tipped me back. That doesn't make sense imo 

T2V has clearly eradicated a lot of the manipulation that was going on and we can see that on the last distribution. Now 'upvotes' are public and there basically are no downvotes I suddenly have my best distribution ever because the vast majority of manipulation has been removed

So it seems to be doing it's job but I just hate it's had to come to this. Always gonna have these kinds of issues when you have generous distributions like we get over here though
