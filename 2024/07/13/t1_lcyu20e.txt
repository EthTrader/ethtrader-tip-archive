You know my view because we’ve spoken about this before. My view is the same as yours and especially this comment is spot on… I think it’s simple. Yes or no or black and white like you said.

With that said Goldie made some great points and I can absolutely understand that side of the spectrum! End of the day, I think mods are supposed to follow Reddit guidelines and so they should be banning any clear alts. It’s not really about what me and you think but if mods are to follow the platform’s guidelines they should ban these alts arisen from reddit wide bans
