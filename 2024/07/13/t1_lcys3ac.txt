>I don't think it's really a black and white issue ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›

I can see and agree with this, but how about sub ripercussion?

i mean Reddit banned those users, so the reason is not bullshit for them, and they clearly states mods should report their alts if they know about them....

so in Reddit mind is a black and white issue I guess... and that's scaring imo
