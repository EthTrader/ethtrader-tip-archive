Thank you. I will ask for that example. 

What you are saying makes. Naturally the content we engage with is the content we like & adding that tip & uv is just the extension of it. The content I don't like I usually ignore, in very rare cases I dv or report it.

Still getting used to EthTrader, maybe we'll see each other a bit more frequently here from now on.

About the weight, I just don't know enough about it. It's something I'll have to research.
