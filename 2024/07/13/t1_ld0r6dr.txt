That all does make sense. 

I got only about 500 donuts & contrib which explains the weight on my tips to you.

I did already know about tipped donuts coming from expected earnings.

Thank you for all the additional information you have given me, particularly regarding distribution. You got 22k donuts last month? That's a decent salary in many parts of the world. WOW & congratulations. :)
