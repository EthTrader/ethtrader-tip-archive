*After his viral interview with Arabian Business, Shiba Inu lead developer has asked Elon Musk for an official sit-out*

# HIGHLIGHTS

* Shytoshi Kusama has sent invitation to meet Elon Musk
* This is considered an ambitious strategy to expand Shiba Inu's influence
* Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson is also making similar push

Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) has sent an open invitation for a sit-out with Elon Musk. This call for a one-on-one did not come as a surprise to followers of the anonymous developer, especially following his recent media showoffs.

# Shiba Inu Dev and Elon Musk Alliance In View?

Earlier, reports broke out that [Shytoshi Kusama](https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-lead-shytoshi-kusama-confirms-india-visit-what-in-store/) and Kaal Dhairya granted their first interview with Arabian Business. In the interview, Shytoshi Kusama clarified the buzz on his identity and comparison with Elon Musk.

He did acknowledge that he is not Elon Musk, denting the hopes of those making the analogy before now. He, however, noted that he would like to meet Elon Musk and show him how it is done. While this statement remains cryptic, it underscores how Kusama want to expand the global reach of the protocol.

With his latest post on X, the Shiba Inu lead has officially called out Elon Musk with the community anticipating a response.

The position of Elon Musk in the crypto industry is one of a patron. As a billionaire with a strong affinity with Dogecoin (DOGE), other crypto projects have been trying to gain his endorsement. One of these is Cardano founder [Charles Hoskinson](https://coingape.com/charles-hoskinson-breaks-silence-on-cardano-partnership-with-elon-musk/) who recently broke silence on his efforts to connect with Elon Musk.

With Hoskinson noting that Cardano’s Midnight Protocol could solve some of the privacy issues on X, this has not earned him an audience with Musk. Whether or not he will secure an audience in the near future remains unknown. With Cardano having a defined goal, many remain uncertain what the Shiba Inu project have to bring on the table.

# The SHIB Ambition

Beyond the quest to connect with Elon Musk, the Shiba Inu developer also revealed the plans to transform SHIB into the first trillion-dollar decentralized project. This is an ambitious vision, however, considering its successes thus far, the confidence the team could pull it off is high.

The developers have teased a number of new innovation for Shibarium and the entire ecosystem in the near future. For now, [Shiba Inu burning](https://coingape.com/shib-burn-skyrockets-4000-amid-shiba-inu-etf-buzz/) and decentralized application introduction on Shibarium remains the core focus of the memecoin project.

At the time of writing, the token is down 0.87% in 24 hours to $0.00001632. This might be interpreted as a vote of no confidence in the pursuit to meet Musk.

any possible explanation?
