Id want to avoid any repercussions on the sub but I don't know what Reddit are like for things like this and if they even that bothered.

I'd hope they aren't really bothered and it isn't worth spending any energy on! 

>i mean Reddit banned those users, so the reason is not bullshit for them 

It may come from a bullshit report through. We see conversations get heated on the sub sometimes and someone could be a c*** and report you for harassment etc and before you know it you've got a bullshit ban! It could happen to any of us that's why I think the context in each scenario matters
