i really dislike him too, and I agree with you on the respectful talks and all...

but I'm not talking only about the t2v, but everything in this sub is just off, pure nonsense...

we have so many rules and the sub is dead... if a newcomer try to make a post the chances are it's going to be deleted... mods are inactive and behaving like an elitarian society....

I dislike that guy, but the more I read him, the more I think he is right ðŸ˜”
