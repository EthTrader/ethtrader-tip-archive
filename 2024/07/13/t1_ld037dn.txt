I think it is so you can't buy voting weight but have to earn it instead. But I don't fully get it either.

I'm not very active in EthTrader but I've heard in a private conversation that "tipping rings" are a thing. Groups of people nearly exclusively tipping each other. 

I feel like you put effort into your response, so thank you.
