Meh, everyone has different interpretations of tipping. The objective of the poll, at least the first time Aminok pitched it was to make upvotes visible and it was pitched as !upvote 

Then someone decided to implement it as !tip instead, but as far as i’m concerned it’s the same thing. You’re giving an upvote. It’s just called tip now. At least the objective was to make *upvotes* transparent. 

Before t2v, people upvoted just about anything. And if I left a comment on something, I would upvote it. And that’s what I just did now. It’s just that suddenly it went from being called !upvote or !uv to !tip but that doesn’t change anything as far as I’m concerned.

The whole hoarding tips or judging how people tip is nonsense imo. I (and many others) upvoted everything they replied to before t2v (many would have called it rediquette) which btw made the other person eligible to earn donut from the distribution formula,  i just did the exact same thing with my !tip. Why should we change the behaviour all a sudden? Well you can if you want to but don’t judge how others do it. 

Again, the objective as far as I know it, when Aminok first pitched it was just to make upvotes transparent, and not start a change to make people change their upvoting behaviours. That’s just a myth that people clinged onto because someone wanted to change it from !upvote to !tip. The principle is still the exact same though if you’d be following the Reddiquette thing imho.
