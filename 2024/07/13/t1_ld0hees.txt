New users still receive the full weighted upvotes. Its the upvotes they're giving out that don't have full weight.

If I'm conversing with a new user and we are upvoting each other its me that would receive less not them. Which I wouldn't hold against a new user by the way! It isn't a new users fault they don't have the contrib immediately!
