Yes and no. I tend to only post about projects I'm invested in, or considering investing in. It's better to keep the discussion on each story contained in 1 post if possible anyway. So, I don't mind if others beat me to ones that I find.

I do find it incredibly amusing when 2 or 3 users post the same article within 5 minutes - all reacting to that notification or hitting F5 at the same time xD
