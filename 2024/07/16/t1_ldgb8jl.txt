I haven't joined Reddit yet during those time, I was probably still in school and only uses this platform for Q&A. But after lurking around to search more about this, I just feel like Reddit just created the ETH Snoos to see if the current avatars will be appreciated by redditors. I just feel bad that those avatars aren't worth anything now or not even in competition with monkey pfp and the pixel ones. I wish Reddit get their shit together. !tip 1
