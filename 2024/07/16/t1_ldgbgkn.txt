Its been paying off nicely and Its had its costly educational hours. 

But It has given me a different kind of wiew on economics, savings and whatnot.

Some people are here looking for financial freedom from financial slavery. And i dont talk about quitting your job. 

Im talking about not having to work 3 jobs or skip meals just because the economy is in the wendys dumpster! 

Good luck out there!
