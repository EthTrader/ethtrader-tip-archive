I'd be very curious to keep track of a stablecoin position.

I'm guessing there would be less Imperma loss recorded if DONUT pumps - because you'd get the stablecoin building up, but when DONUT dumps you'd still be left with a lot of reduced value DONUT.

On the flipside. Potentially less rewards, because stablecoin wiill never pump, and ETh and DONUT can increase in value together.

Finally, most people might convert stablecoin to ETH anyway xD
