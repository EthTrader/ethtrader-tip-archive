If they did, that would be great. because thatâ€™s how airdrops should be, an unexpected pleasant surprise. Airdrops should be done AFTER launch, not before to bait an entire user base and attract farmers.

Most of the time, projects hint at airdrops to generate revenue, volume, and obtain cheap marketing content for visibility. Airdrops nowadays are complete garbage, if you ask me.

I was a bit skeptical about Base, because of all the memecoin saga. But they have been doing a great job, and seem to be scaling up effectively. Honestly, Arbitrum might have a real opponent here.
