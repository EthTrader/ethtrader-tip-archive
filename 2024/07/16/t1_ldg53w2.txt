Polygon's continuously scaling and developing partnerships. They've improved the DeFi space a lot with their solutions, but unfortunately MATIC / POL hasn't been able to keep pace.

Of course, usually tech development doesn't necessarily have an impact on the asset's price. But I think the market value of MATIC / POL doesn't seem to reflect the same level of growth and enthusiasm. There's a big gap between the project's potential and the token's market performance.
