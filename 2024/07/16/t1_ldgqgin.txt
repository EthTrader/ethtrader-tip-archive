Very, very unlikely that any other, new or not, chain will flip Ethereum.

Ethereum is the backbone of the DeFi industry. It pioneered the concept of smart contracts and dApps. It pretty much established a foundation that other chains are still trying to emulate. This is what sets Ethereum apart as a leader in the industry. It will always be the number one because of its first-mover advantage and the big network effects that come with it.

But that's not all, honestly. Ethereum is constantly scaling, mainly because of the growth of Layer 2 solutions. This means more transactions, while maintaining security and decentralization. 

Also, it seems a lot of people don't understand that Ethereum is the most profitable network in the industry. It's even more profitable than most companies in the S&P 500. This consequently will attract devs, investors, institutions, users, etc.

Just my two cents.
