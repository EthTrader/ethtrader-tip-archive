I think Ethereum sets the precedent and will remain the number 1 eco-system. (Note, not saying it will flip BTC, but BTC is one dimensional)

BSC/BNB is Ethereum's biggest competitor, and it's so far behind.

We might see a new alternative L1 compete with the likes of ADA or SOL... but I don't think there will be anything new, anytime soon that competes with ETH.
