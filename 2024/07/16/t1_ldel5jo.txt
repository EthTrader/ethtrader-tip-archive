This one is worth the appeal.

These ones can be tricky, because if a certain percentage of it is similar, it'll still be considered a duplicate - and the primary point of both articles is the price action over the movement point on the charts. And because nobody actually reads the articles being shared, all the comments on both posts are the same xD

I'd say you just scrape in on technicality xD
