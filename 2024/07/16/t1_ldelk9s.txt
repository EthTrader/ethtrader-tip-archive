>Did you ever checked what would be the outcome if we kept the same reward amount? Maybe you could include it in the next post?

I think that's going to be too difficult to work out, because of the way different positions have different ranges, and therefore take a variable percentage of the reward... all I can definitely say is, rewards would be better xD

Atleast we are up to 150k DONUT per month now, originally at 100k. Gnosis of course was 200k.
