Thank you for understanding, that is exactly how it feels.

Luckily, it’s a small minority of people that hate me, and it all originates from the same person, it just spread out more than it should have. Trust me, you haven’t seen the worst of it. Those who hate me probably don’t even understand why, and they are so blinded, that they fail to see what has been achieved so far.

Could they do what I do? Would they prefer that nobody did this, and that there was no development whatsoever? Their free tokens would remain stale, without utility, visibility and, consequently, no price appreciation whatsoever.

Also, I’ve noticed that those who complain the most, whether about me, the moderation team or the developers, are those who produce no content at all, or post low-effort submissions, and sell their earnings on a monthly basis. So, luckily, if something like this Donut Initiative comes to a governance poll, their votes are irrelevant. Also, I will add that Donut Initiatives are not Governance Polls, it’s not something that can technically be voted on.

But yes, they don’t really understand the mechanics and factors behind all of this, and all they see is the price, like it can be controlled by myself alone. No pump? Bye! No Cex listing? Bye!

In any case, thanks for your support, I see you’re an investor and you’re the type of user I would like to see in our ecosystem.
