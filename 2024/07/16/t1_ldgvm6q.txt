there wouldn't b a place for tip command to go to until post itself get's approved to b eligible for tips & t2v, as donut bot message & pinned comment "that u can tip the post" only appears after post itself is approved, that explains why f u tip a post that doesn't have the pinned donut bot tipping comment(only appears after post itself approved) "simply nothing would happen", but still much thanks for approving much of my posts without that i wouldn't b able to receive any t2v
