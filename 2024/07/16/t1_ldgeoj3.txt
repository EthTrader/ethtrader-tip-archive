A quality comedy post is always appreciated.

Project comparisons and deep dives is always good - but rarely see anything of even half decent quality on that front - because the fact is, they take effort.

Airdrop guides have been quite helpful in the past.

I always take the time to read text posts that people put effort into writing out.

But just because you can post, doesn't mean you have to. If you're trying to create something for the hell of it, you probably won't be that inspired - and it really shows in some cases.
