Honestly, theres a lot more cheaters than people would like to believe.

There were atleast 2 people who had rings of 5 accounts that got banned, so thats 10 accounts from 2 people alone... let alone those that "only" run 1 or 2 alts.

As for not caring about being here anymore? Well, nobody needs to be here 24-7 either.

If someone "only" comes here few a few minutes a day, or a few times a week is that a bad thing? Not necessarily.

I still enjoy lurking some subs every couple of days, despite only commenting once in a while. Doesn't mean I don't like the sub, just means I didn't have anything to say. 

I think we're just to used to some accounts being here nearly 16 hours a day and the fact we compare "effort" with "reward" as per the donut distribution.

It's clear as crystal some users don't participate is subs that don't have community points at all.

I say this as a user who's been active on Reddit for 12 years across multiple subs. EthTrader sits at my 3rd highest sub based on Karma - and there are 5 subs where I have earned over 10k karma.
