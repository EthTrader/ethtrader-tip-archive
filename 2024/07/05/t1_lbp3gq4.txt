Is it just me or is their crypto card offerings just kind of bad? I was excited for their card to begin with, but the yearly fees just seem bizarre to me. Are people really willing to pay a one-time fee of 10 eth just to get a credit card? Even their lowest tier card costs 0.01 eth per year, and the points-per-dollar-spent benefits don't seem that worth it. I can get better points rewards with my regular credit cards that have 0 annual fees. I guess if you're looking to spend your crypto in a less-traceable way, without having to cash out through an exchange (and pay taxes) then maybe it's worth it.
