I like the hopium of your post, but it's not realistic.

The question about crypto I've always wondered is, where is the top? So far, every 4 years, crypto goes through a kind of parabolic bullrun where billions of wealth is added to the market. This cycle cannot continue forever. 

Where will Bitcoin and Ethereum "top-out" where they become more a store of wealth instead of appreciating assets? And more importantly, WHEN will they top out?
