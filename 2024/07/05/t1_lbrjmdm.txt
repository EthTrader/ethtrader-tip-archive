I've been posting a weekly update on my liquidity position as well as a general state of the Sushi.com pool - it shows week by week updates on how the position fluctuates. 

As of right now, I'm quite rekt by Impermanent Loss - but the general gist is, you supply say, $50 of ETH and $50 of DONUT... then as someone wants to buy DONUT, they give you eth, you give them DONUT, now your liquidity position is rebalanced with more ETH, less DONUT.

It gets complicated as the value of both assets change - but yes, if DONUT were to pump, and lots of buy orders, my position could become 0 DONUT and lots of ETH.

Hope that helps xD

Feel free to search my "Diving Into The Donut Pool" posts for more info - otherwise, my next update will come Monday.
