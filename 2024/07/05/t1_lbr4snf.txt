Or from the other perspective, the idea is that over half of the members used to be cheats, over half. That's gross. (It's not true, loads of good people left and some directly told us so it's not an opinion thing, but still!)


Cheating is down, tipping is up, upvotes are down, over half the members left. There's some good and some bad, the important bit is being honest and accountable with ourselves and everyone about the mistakes and successes. We all see the pushback to t2v and we all see the positives, no use pretending it's all bad or all good.
