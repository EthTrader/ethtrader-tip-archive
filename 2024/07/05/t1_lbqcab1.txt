I have been playing GTA V online for a lot of hours and they have the perfect ecosystem to do it. There is basically their own economy inside that game and crypto can be really helpful with that. I think they 100% have it in mind but we need real regulations so they jump into it.

Let see what happens. My bet is a no and maybe a yes between the 8 years wait until GTA VII. I mean, it would be wise that if after 4 years of GTA VI Online and clear regulations to use it as "testing" for the next one.
