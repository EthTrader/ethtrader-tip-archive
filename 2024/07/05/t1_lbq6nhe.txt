I doubt the token will return to ATH's, but I do think it'll pump nicely. It's a staple name and we haven't really quite gained the full media attention and begun to onboard new users to crypto yet.

I think it will rise above my average cost price of 24c - which will make all my CRO cashback quite rewarding when the markets become euphoric again.
