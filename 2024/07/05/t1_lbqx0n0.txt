If I had to put a number to it, I'd say 75% of the no longer active users' were alt accounts.

I would also wager there are still some active alt accounts, coz, cheaters gonna cheat no matter what!

I agree, 4k comments is a lot. But, each to their own, I'm not here to judge anyone's hobbies or passions. I was a lot more active on Reddit during COVID lockdowns, and I'm generally more active here when it's either too hot or too cold to be outdoors.

If what they say is helpful and people decide to tip their content, good for them. I just hope people tip content based on the content, not based on who submitted it.

In anycase, I will continue to be active in this sub, I will continue to be active on Reddit in general, including the non-crypto subs I subscribe to.
