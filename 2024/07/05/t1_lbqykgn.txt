So around 25% of the people gone were good users and not alts or cheaters, if 260 left then that's what 65 to 70ish good people lost.Â 


There are definitely cheaters and alts here. It's lowered it for sure, but also droge away many good members. I hated the spam as well so not against all the changes.


I'm just trying to assertain for sure that I'm not losing it and lots of the people left were decent and it's bizarre to call them all cheaters to protect the idea that t2v wasn't a big mistake. All the emotion is so confusing to me, the reality is what it is and I can't see why denying it is not more damaging than the truth.


Carry on as you were, nothing is gonna make anyone stop and I dont expect or want that, just trying to wade through these falsities to find the actual truth.


Thanks for your thoughtful replies as always, I take a lot from them.
