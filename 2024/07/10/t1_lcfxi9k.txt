It'll be 500 (or slightly more don't remember) but yeah that's a good point. I hope you're right and I could still cut it somehow with the 1.5k LXP I had before that + the ~500 + 105k lxpL. Tired of taking big Ls on airdrops haha. 

Btw etherfi season 2 looks good with the bonus for lower fish like me (qualified for 130) but I guess it'll dump hard again right after the second season drop. What is your experience on that topic? Do coins drop as hard with the second drop as with the first? Appreciate it !tip 1
