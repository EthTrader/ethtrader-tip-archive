It’s all relative but to me it’s fairly safe. Maybe it’d moderately risky if I had a short time horizon but I’m looking to hold it for the mid- long term, plus I have plenty of other risky mid and small cap investments… so, to me fairly safe… But someone only in equities might call Ethereum volatile and risky.
