Al news articles are usually question based and a little annoying. Like "will Ethereum get to $3500 this week?" Can chainlink survive the downtrend? Stuff like that.

Avoid coinstats or Coinotag news articles. Coinotag uses AI to change news article and then repost it. Unless you post their news articles first, you're likely making a double post. !tip 1
