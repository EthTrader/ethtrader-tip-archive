I don't really know what do with a checker if I don't know the price haha. What do you expect? I like the project and I'm okay with everything since I'd restake my Sol anyways. 

I also enjoy using Kaminos multiply feature. You should give it a look if you haven't yet. Probably with JupSol to increase the likelihood to qualify for jup s2 as well. Their risk disclosure is great.
