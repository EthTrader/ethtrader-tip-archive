I've never made a play on GRT before; but I remember it having a good run out of the blue at some stage. 

Was worth as much as $2 in 2021 - but with supply inflation, only managed to hit 45c earlier this year.

It seems to have some AI hype movement associated with it, and seems like it would be a profitable buy, but ultimately, i think there are better options. 

Unless anyone who follows the project more closely has some input xD
