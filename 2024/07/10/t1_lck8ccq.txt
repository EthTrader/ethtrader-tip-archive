Since Elon took over. Crypto twitter hasn't been like before. I remember those days under Jack where anything crypto related will definitely sell on twitter. Now I'm not even sure what happens to CT anymore. Everyone just posting shitty stuff to get money through Elon's verification. Right now, crypto Reddit is kinda better than twitter fr. And I was also in Reddit from the twitter hype of Reddit avatars. !tip 1
