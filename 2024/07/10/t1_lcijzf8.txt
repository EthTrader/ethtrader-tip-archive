The difference lies between Crypto devs trying to build shitty grinding games with crypto as the primary focus - if crypto and gaming is to have success, its going to have to come from legitimate gaming companies who include crypto, whilst maintaining a primary focus on actually building an  enjoyable quality game.

Nothing wrong with NFT's being a part of it, whether it be NFT ownership, NFT season passes or even things like NFT specs/skins - just like normal, and reasonably priced micro transactions.
