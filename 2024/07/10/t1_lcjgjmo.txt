Not much tbh, I was late to it, but will probably either insta sell my allocation and convert it to JUP or pool it in Meteora to get some fees. I was lending my INF in Kamino as well, now withdrew everything from there already to ape a bit more in Meteora lol and super bullish on JUP as well, the firsr ASR batch was nice
