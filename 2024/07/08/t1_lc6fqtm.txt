I'm Salvadoran, we supported crypto but the downside is not everyone understands cryptocurrency nor did they know what crypto is actually for. The only reason people uses crypto then is because govt trying to force people using it, that's why they gift $50 each to people who open a chivo wallet account but since then, lots of people lose interest in crypto. Cash is widely accepted and only few mall accepts cryptocurrency. !tip 1
