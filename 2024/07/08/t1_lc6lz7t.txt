 I don't know exactly what the reason is. But I think you're right. It seems to me that Aminok is a mod that regulates almost everything on its own in the daily and post sections. Raymv1987 is also still active. 

Maybe they are a bit overwhelmed with the ideas and implementations in addition to their mod work. But I believe that Friendly-Airline2426 enjoys a higher reputation thanks to its marketing work and that people are more likely to approach them more quickly. But I still wouldn't see it as a negative. 

Maybe we just need more active mods that care about ideas from our bronuts. I still believe that they all love us equally. Their time is also limited and I think it just has to do with that.
