> I might be seeing more things proving my theses because I'm surely biased,

This happens a LOTTT

There was all sorts of drama a few months back with YesterPhillipines - who got mad and left for a week, because they thought they were beiing targetted by posts being deleted. It wasn't until they saw just how many people were having posts deleted, they calmed down and realized it wasn't personal. 

> but then I see other (Serie A) people talking, and aminok is brainstorming with them right after.

I would speculate this is a time thing - do they have the time right now to discuss what they see? yes? discuss now!!   No? No discuss. But no reminder to discuss later either.

> and I know that it's impossible to discuss with me when I am in a specific complaining mood

> you may remember how messed up things were going after my band and bvandepol one, you even admitted that moderation could prevent that shitshow just handling things differently.

You don't do yourself any favours, thats for sure. And you say yourself you push the boundaries... so perhaps you shouldn't be so surprised you did get banned, because, lets face it, you know you continued to press after getting a warning. From memory Bvand did not get a specific warning, but got banned alongside with you - can't remember exactly, that was a whiile back now.

But hey, even LuisGadget continues to be active - which means they don't get banned - but lets face it, half their complaints even if based on accurate data, are probably having less consideration because their comments are full of aggression and rudeness rather than civil understanding. 

So if there is a case of Series A and Series B bronuts, I'd say, It takes two to tango afterall.  And instead of looking to start a fight, people will get more productivity and resolution out of civil conversations.

It's funny when you see r/cc mods say the same thing about this sub xD
