I mean, there probably was a decent percentage of them that were cheaters, but a lot were legit users too, I expect.

Another thing is, if all those users WERE cheating, then that means 80% of the userbase were cheating, and when their method doesn't work anymore, they all leave. Which in theory means the whole sub was built on cheating, lol.

I still see a lot of familiar faces here, which is amazing to see, but I also see that most have left, and that's sad. Aside from earning donuts, I legit enjoy conversing here and making new friends whilst chatting about the crypto we love and believe in!

It's all gone to pot, and the price reflects that sadly, and I love donuts, so it sucks to say.
