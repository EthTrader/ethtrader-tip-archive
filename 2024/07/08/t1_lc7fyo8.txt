I think for a while there it seemed like the price might keep rising so activity was high, now all these changes, loads of drama and the price crashed and all those people left.. I dont really know why I remain if I'm honest I ask myself too often why I actually bother ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

Good talk, you dont have to keep tipping me, my weight is low and these comments really aren't quality enough to justify.
