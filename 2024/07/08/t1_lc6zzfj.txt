Yes, I see it from the perspective that something has only happened since the end of 2023/beginning of 2024. Many developers I trust are working on the donut project. Donut has been around for a while, but I've only seen the time loop really live for about 7 months. Many coins that enjoy recognition today take 2 years or more for the price to change. 

I'm patient and would give donut another year and then we'll all be rich :D  Community coins will be the new social media.
