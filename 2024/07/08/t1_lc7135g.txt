It's a healthy way of thinking about feeling disadvantaged. However, we only have 2 very active mods in my opinion and those are Aminok and Ray. 

I think they will consider your suggestions for now, since you do a lot for the sub and put a lot of effort into marketing. 

I also had to repeat myself a few times, for example when it came to the sidebar: “How to provide liquidity for sushi or how to buy sushi” should appear on the sidebar. But now it´s visible.

It bothered me a bit too, but  I think there's just a lack of moderation. Many mods are simply inactive and those that are active are overwhelmed. That's my way of seeing things.
