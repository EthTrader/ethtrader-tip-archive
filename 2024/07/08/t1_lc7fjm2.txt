> In my opinion, the voting weight is also an important factor

Bro, i think voting weight is a non factor tbh. If couple of users vote together they can outgun every single member together in this sub. So basically if 99% vote yes and they vote no, guess who wins? Yep, the NO will win. 

You would need to spend years farming to be able to compete. 

So trust me when i say, almost no one is here for voting power, maybe the Aussie matt is üòÅ
