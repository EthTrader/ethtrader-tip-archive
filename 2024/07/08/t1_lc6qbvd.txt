100% true.

I agree with you Fred. 99% of people who are here daily, are farming donuts, and that is ok. Everyone would sell their bag if they meet their price target and that is also ok.

People need to stop shaming "farmers" and sellers cause  they are shaming themselves xD.  Its that bizarre lol
