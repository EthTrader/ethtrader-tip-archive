The definition of financial freedom is to have enough resources to pay for all your living expenses and life goals without commiting any time to earn money.

Working part time to fund your living expenses and life goals by commiting your time to the part time job is contrary to the nonsubjective meaning of financial freedom. There is no asterisk next to freedom, and no such thing as part time freedom. It's freedom or it's not there's no differing opinion.
