I saw that too, even though many users said without a doubt the only reason they left is because of t2v. 

If someone can say that and you still don't believe them what does that say about the person listening? To call them all cheaters or second accounts as well is just so disappointing. 

Imagine this.

Me: 'Nah I didn't fancy a pint last night, I was busy with my kid'

You: 'NO, you DID fancy the pint you lied to me and everyone else and probably were at a different pub drinking.' 

You would disown that friend with gusto, right away, and never entertain anything they ever said or did ever again.
