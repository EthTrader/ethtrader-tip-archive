lol ðŸ™ƒ 
gotta keep up with my reputation ðŸ˜Ž

>And you're not gonna like my answer

wrong! I'm not looking for "you're right" answers (this time ðŸ‘€) so I'm genuinely interested in knowing your opinions!

and thanks for taking the time to draft such a detailed reply!

I might be seeing more things proving my theses because I'm surely biased, so thanks for sharing your post as an example!

and I totally agree with you on the mods situation and the "waking up to 40 tags" thing, but at the same time I have never seen a single mod doing anything to solve this, like searching for help or even discussing about it. Once I suggested aminok to have a mod meeting to discuss how to fix their job but he keep replying standard things such as "we are better than the bad r/cc mods, we got nothing going wrong", and that's disappointing because the ones you mentioned are imo serious problems and are creating issue with the sub growth

but then I see other (Serie A) people talking, and aminok is brainstorming with them right after.

now... I'm not stupid (I hope ðŸ‘€), and I know that it's impossible to discuss with me when I am in a specific complaining mood, but before I even get there, mods could do a better job listening...

you may remember how messed up things were going after my band and bvandepol one, you even admitted that moderation could prevent that shitshow just handling things differently.... and this exactly here isy point... with us, series B bronuts, things alway escalate, cause we aren't listened to, and it's frustrating ðŸ™ƒ

PS: sorry for not providing a tldr ðŸ˜…
