>So many holders here just witch hunt other users and calling them out for selling

They are doing that cause selling is killing their price. They want price to go up so they can dump their bag at higher price and earn more money.

That is a fact and everyone knows this is the truth.

I think everyone should have freedom to do whatever they want without being judged or penalised by the community.
