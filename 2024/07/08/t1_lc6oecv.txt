Regarding the ”farming” thing, the truth is I’m a farmer, you’re a farmer, the dudes who ”pretend to not farm” are farmers. If you turn up here everyday you’re a ”farmer”. 

It’s just that some people have, what they consider more ethical or less ethical ways to go about it. But everyone out of the regulars is a farmer here, even if some are trying hard to not be one. I’m sorry but that’s the case. Because you don’t utilize every earnings meta, like posting news 3x a day, it doesn’t nevessarily make you a non-farmer.

Some people are just farmers with an aura of not being one.
