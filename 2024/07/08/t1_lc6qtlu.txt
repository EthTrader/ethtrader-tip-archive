Exactly. This aren't RCC who penalised you if you sell. Donut is just a community currency and if you sell, you have less power than people who hold. So I don't think they should be shaming people who sell. So many holders here just witch hunt other users and calling them out for selling which is bad. It's their donut, let them do whatever they want with it. !tip 1Â
