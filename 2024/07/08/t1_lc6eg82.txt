We will never know... I blame Gary Gensler because if I am not wrong the main reason why sunset happened is because Reddit receive a letter from SEC and taking in count that Reddit ICO was coming + shitty Reddit Gold + unclear crypto regulations... If I was Reddit, I would have done the same. Money > whatever when running a company.

I wonder if there will be a time when Reddit approaches again RCPs to support them again. Rectifying is wise.
