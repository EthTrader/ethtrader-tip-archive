I don't think they'll make big profits no, but they aren't meant for that right? They're half a governance token and work exactly as intended, so if by believe you mean the voting stuff then yes fine. And if by believe you mean believe you can make big profits then no I'm really not sure it'll bounce back after over 1/2 of the active members left and many so many dumped/dump bags. Crypto is all hype and this has no way to generate any and noone making any ground on it.
