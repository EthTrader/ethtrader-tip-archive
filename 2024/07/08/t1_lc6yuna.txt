My comment about almost everyone being a farmer got downvoted hard xD

I guess some people cant accept the truth xD 

They like to think, they are here for the tech, spending absurd time to farm 10k, 15k or 20k+ donuts each month, only for the tech xD 😂

Time to face reality and embrace the truth. I know i did and i have no problem saying it. 

Stop shaming "farmers"! 

Embrace the "farmer" status, that is totally fine 😁
