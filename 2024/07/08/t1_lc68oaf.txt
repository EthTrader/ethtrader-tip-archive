We only really started working on Donut at the end of 2023/beginning of 2024. When I landed here in August 2023, the daily consisted of 1k comments per day and hey bronut, goodnight bronut etc. 

Nothing comes out of nowhere and needs some time. Look at big coins like Ethereum.

 The price hasn't changed for a while. But I'm sure that we'll find application and that Donut could get a lot of attention through social media hype, for example.  

I'm sticking with it. Community coins will become really big!
