I agree with them being overwhelmed due to the fact that they are probably the only 2 mods moderating the sub, while the other are missing/gone or developers.

but I tried several times coming to reason with aminok, simply asking him to listen the community and even only take in consideration the mod team needs to be revised, but he didn't listen.

plus, I m probably the worst for trying these approaches since i tend to become angry easily and escalating makes the communication hard, but man I saw my far share of shit and not fair stuff happening in this sub, and I truly thing this is the worst mod team across all the Reddit sub
