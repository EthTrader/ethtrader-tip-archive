I think I'd rather have a busy daily, twice as many members and the token worth twice as much, than whatever this is. The old system didn't work and allowed all sorts of bad, the new system has scared more than half the community away but some of them that left happened to be cheating. This is barely better and all the criticism is being ignored. All the farmers did was change strat slightly to fit. It's the same people in any scenario, so stupid.
