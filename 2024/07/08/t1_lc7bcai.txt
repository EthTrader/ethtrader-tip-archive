Yes I know you do a very nice job as mod here and your time is also limited, but some mods like [u/dont\_forget\_canada](https://new.reddit.com/user/dont_forget_canada/) or [u/nootropicat](https://new.reddit.com/user/nootropicat/)  I've never read here before and I've been here almost a year. 

 It would be nice if you and Ray could get more support for moderation. Maybe we could then process the bronuts' suggestions faster and better and wouldn't have this kind of discussion. 

Thanks for the tip sir.
