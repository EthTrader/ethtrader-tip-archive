> If you do intend to invest in ETH, I recommend Dollar Cost Averaging, as it's the best way to build a position in a highly volatile asset.

DCA is a great starting strategy for rookies and people wanting to build up a position, but after a while it's okay to re-assess and adjust as both your position increases and market sentiments change.

From my own experience, I FOMO'd a bit in 2021, I DCA'd in 2022, but in 2023 as I noticed the upward trend, I stopped DCAing and switched to a lump sum, buy the dip. I bought 4 local low ranges in 2023, and that proved to be much more effective than DCA.

DCA is good to a certain point, but everyone needs to adjust to constantly changing circumstances.
