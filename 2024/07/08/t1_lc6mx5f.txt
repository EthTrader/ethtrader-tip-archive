Fully on board with all of that, loads of legitimate users have decided to go and never return and there is no way they were cheaters. Even if they were you can't prove an intent in someone else's mind so no legit way to claim anything like that on logical grounds.

I think cheating was definitely extremely common, but that didn't stop there's still cheating and weird vote patterns, and the farmers remaining just altered their tact to conform with the new ways to earn them. 

I checked the CSV yesterday and the earning accounts went down by 1/2 and at least half of the remaining members earned 10 or less tips.. it's a mess. The cheating went down and so did overall activity of undeniably legitimate people like me or you or the many others being told they are cheaters or lying about leaving because of t2v.
