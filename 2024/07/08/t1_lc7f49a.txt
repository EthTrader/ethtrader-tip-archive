is not about moving slowly aminok, and we all see the great effort that it takes to moderate this place, especially because you are one of the very few active mods in here!

I'm honest when I say that I appreciate most of the things you say and do during your time on the sub, not that it should matters to you

but I seriously invite you and the other mods to pay a little bit attention on how you treat differently us all, 'cause  sometimes is so evident, and you at least have to read and acknowledge the several opinions like mine share in the original comment I made. I'm telling you the feeling some of us have is that one, and of course we might be wrong, but being several people and pretty frustrating, would be nice for you to try and keep an eye out on what we're saying

that's all
