I'm optimistic about ZK and BLAST.

End of the day, they have only been released this year, and when general market sentiment becomes euphoric - they are the new tokens that haven't experienced a bull run before, that haven't got bag holders from a previous bull run, and investors who disappear in a bear market haven't seen before.
