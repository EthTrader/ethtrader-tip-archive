I don't think I could handle it. xD

As much as I want to see this sub change for the better, I guess "better" is also subjective based on my vision - I think if I "had" to be here, I'd lose interest - it's nice to be able to walk away, like I barely spent any time here in the daily in the last week until the snapshot data was released.

Hell, even after running those contests for 1 month, I felt a little drained from forcing myself to be here at the same time 3 days a week with about 30-45mins of prep-work to get things posted in a certain time frame - I couldn't imagine having a routine that involved patrolling the sub and searching for duplicates to remove once a day etc... and then of course the complaints about said decisions.

besides, I have zero dev skills, and that's probably the thing the sub needs most, someone to complement MattG and help his split his work-load.
