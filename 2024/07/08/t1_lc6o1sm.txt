Yes I remember, they had to make up provably false accusations and change the whole laws to fail at banning me as well to protect the thin skinned from hurtful truths as well and I stopped trying to help or contribute because it was absolutely absurd and clearly a personal problem. It didn't work but the anger was so real, now you've got an angry cynical person in the community, good job ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

It's not in your head mate. It's just too real, too true, it touches a nerve because you're absolutely spot on correct. If you were talking shit they'd dismiss but they don't they go on the counter attack defensive which shows you were bang on the money.
