Absolutely right. There is an in group of untouchables who can't do anything wrong even when they have alts or get caught out nothing happens to them, the rest of us just bask in the illusion of participation.

The way donut works is to keep people unequal though, like more contrib gives more vote weight. It is not democratic and everyone doesn't have the exact same say, and this is reflected in the social dynamics too. Being friendly, kissing asses and so on is a non tangible currency and it's just as powerful as holding a lot of contrib. 

I think maybe the flaw was assuming fairness and equality in a crypto set up to maximize and exaggerate inequality. The donut issuance rate has gone down a lot, it halved once according to the research I did, so if you've been here a while you also had an unequal ability to earn them easier too. Almost none of it was ever supposed to be a level playing field.

Nobody cares though so don't spend much worry on this Rik, if anything you're very well liked here by the actual members and when you speak some people listen.
