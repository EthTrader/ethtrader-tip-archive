>There is an in group of untouchables who can't do anything wrong even when they have alts

oh I know, me and U/bvandepol have been banned for only mentioning those alts, while one of them got double distribution with the 2 accounts 😅

>Nobody cares though so don't spend much worry on this Rik, if anything you're very well liked here by the actual members and when you speak some people listen

oh I know nobody cares, and I have 0 hopes this place will start working decently, I only wanted to know about other people's opinion since I complain a lot and sometimes things are only in my head 😅

🙏🏻❤️🍩
