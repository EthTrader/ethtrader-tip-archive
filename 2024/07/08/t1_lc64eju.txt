Yeh, I don't blame ya there!

In hindsight, I probably should've expect some sort of DONUT dip, but I didn't think it would drop this much... I also didn't think trading volume would be this low.

I wouldve been better off having a slighter broader range, but I won't be surprised to see DONUT have another run now that T2V is in play, and alt's are earning less. Plus Airline continues to work hard at reaching other parties.
