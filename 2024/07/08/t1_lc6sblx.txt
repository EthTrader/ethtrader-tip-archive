I wouldn't expect anything different from you... xD

And you're not gonna like my answer, because, I'll agree with Ray on the "formatted proposals" and pre-discussions - but even those efforts sometimes get zero feedback, like this one of mine for example - [Donut Trading Contest - concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1dfppjd/donut_trading_contest_concept/) Whether this is lack of interest, or simply unseen.

I always do a pre-proposal discussion post before drafting a final copy, and sometimes I get zero mod feedback - so I have no choice but to proceed - and tag mods to sign off on formatting. 

I'm gonna agree with Sky as well, I think they are overwhelmed in workload, even though this is a small community, it's a LOT of work. MattG is pretty much the only dev we have, who is lumped with everything on that front, Jake, Ray and Aminok moderate the sub, but Jake seems to have periods where he's on consistently and then periods of absence.

I'm not sure what the other mods involvements even are - and Reddito is really just a data-collector.

This is where r/cc management is a much better system, but it's also necessary because of the larger size of the community.

A Dedicated sub  ( r/ccmeta ) to discuss proposals - and of course, mods with specific roles to play, eg, the alt-hunters, the content curators, the mod-mail complaints, general in house organization etc.

Someone like Aminok waking up to like, 40 different tags wouldn't help any workload situation either, not to mention all the other moderator notifications, mod-mails, reports and comment replies.

TLDR - i'd say, as I was saying even last year, the primary problem is the lack of rule definitions and sub organization and structure.
