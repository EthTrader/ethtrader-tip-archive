not going to start again with my infinite complain, but I tried mate. At least I think I did.
once I joined this sub I was doing contests, giveaways and stuff like that with the aim of bringing in new registered users, and believe me, many registered because of me with a couple of posts that I shared in other communities and I spend hours describing people how to register here back then with the old system, and taking time to explain how the sub worked... but I stopped as soon as I was treated like shit, so i only feel complaining and donut farming now, I'm sorry 

I'm convinced about what I said, but I know anyone can have his ideas so I don't need to change yours ðŸ™ƒ

you do you and keep up with the good stuff mate
