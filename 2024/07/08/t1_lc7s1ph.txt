I think BLAST season 2 lasts like 12 months... to me, this actually feels like a perfect timing, where BLAST will benefit in the next 12 months from a bull run, but their circulating supply won't increase dramatically until after the fact.

That said, i would buy ZK over BLAST if I had to pick one at the current price.
