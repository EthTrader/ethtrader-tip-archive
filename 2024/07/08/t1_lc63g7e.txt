Probably chose the worst time to start this database - coming off previous donut pumps that were boosted by Arbitrum migration news. Just been a bleed-out since as a sell the news type of event.

However, I still think DONUT a role in then future, nothing unrealistic like 10c or anything, but I do believe as developments gain traction, and we improve our networking, Advertisers will start to give us a go, much like the advertising done in r/cc

It's up to us as a community to improve the overall quality of the sub, and appeal to new users to grow.
