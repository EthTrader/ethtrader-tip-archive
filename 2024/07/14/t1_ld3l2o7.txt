>Ahead of the Spot Ethereum ETF launch, large holders of Pepe (PEPE) memecoin have been selling off significant portions of their holdings, contrary to the bullish sentiment in the market. This sell-off has led to a decline in PEPE's price, which is currently down 49.27% from its all-time high.

This was to happen and on the cards.
