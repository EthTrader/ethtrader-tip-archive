Because people like new things.

Polygon has been around for 2 full cycles now.

Old tokens like ADA, FTM, ONE, VET, ALGO enjoyed their first bull run last cycle, and now they're done.

New tokens like ZK, STRK, BLAST, ARB, OP will likely all enjoy their first bull run. The first 3 in particular, don't have bag holders as they were only released this year.

This is nothing to do with what the token does, but everything to do with hype.

Outside of BTC and ETH, everything is pretty much a shitshow - but which ones are new, and don't have people looking to desperately sell to regain something?
