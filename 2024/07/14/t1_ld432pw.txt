I feel more safe in ARB One. A lot more known blockchain and I believe in it so the perfect combo.

I think MATIC would have been a good option too but being a sidechain and all those other RCPs on Polygon makes me thing that being in ARB One makes DONUT different. Let see if Polygon decides to evolve into an ETH L2s and ditch sidechain. I think that would be a good approach for their future and even to reduce costs because being an L2s means that you already inherit the good things of the L1 in a really easier way.
