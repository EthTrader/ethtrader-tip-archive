He really does change post flairs which clearly aren't self stories and that on multiple users. Self Stories are pretty self explanatory but he just changes posts that he considers low effort to self story. I agree that we can have clearer guidelines for the flairs though but defending the unregistered bully who changes flairs on posts that clearly aren't self stories isn't the right path imo. !tip 1
