For example this:

>The Pectra upgrade is a huge deal. It’s all about optimizing data processing, which could seriously boost Ethereum’s performance. It’s like giving your car a turbo boost, making everything run smoother and faster. And let’s not forget about the PeerDAS testnet. This is another big step towards improving Ethereum’s scalability. More scalability means Ethereum can handle more transactions, which is crucial for its growth.

>Vitalik Buterin’s talk at the conference also shed light on some important points. He talked about the need for protocol simplification. In simpler terms, this means making the whole system easier to understand and use. This could attract more developers and users to the Ethereum network.
