Impossible to say. With you referring to them as newbies though I'm assuming you mean active Shitnuts with alts that would also comment and engage with people. If an alt is going to do that T2V shouldn't matter. All they have to do is tip multiple people that aren't their alts to blend in

It's more effort for alts so I do think it has definitely got rid of some. Let's be honest though if someone was determined to farm with alts we all know it wouldn't be hard
