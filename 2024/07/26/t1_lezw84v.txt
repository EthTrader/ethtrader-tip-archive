Hamster Kombat isn't time consuming either really. I just open it a few times a day for coins and upgrade stuff. Probably spend 10 mins a day on it.

After a couple of days you move that fast the tapping element for coins isn't worth it so you don't need to do the time consuming stuff.

What's the Kuoro one about? Is that a telegram game too?
