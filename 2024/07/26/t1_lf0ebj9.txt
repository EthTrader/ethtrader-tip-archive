Campaign promises is a natural part of the game. In this year's elections, candidates are taking advantage of the immense popularity and economic weight of crypto, to attract votes.

Crypto surged a lot in importance, especially this year. The largest financial institutions like BlackRock are now heavily invested in the crypto market, which significantly influences its growth. These institutions control pretty much everything, they have a massive financial power, and often have influence over political scenarios. With that being said, candidates have no choice but, to at the very least, pretend they're pro-crypto.

If a candidate is openly anti-crypto, that's the end for them. They risk losing critical support from voters and influential financial entities. 

So that's why politicians craft their campaign promises to reflect a favorable stance on crypt adoption, making sure they're viable options for the office.
