It's also not much to share when there are only a few users

I used to do a lot of airdrop guides. Nowadays when I make one there's barely 20 comments ? And that's not a one off, I've noticed this trend for the last 5 posts I made.

Compare it to the past where I could get close to 100 comments and lots of people interested to learn. Now what's the point anymore?
