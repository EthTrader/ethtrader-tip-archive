It's a mixture of different things. There are less alts because of T2V but lord knows how many less and how much of a difference that has made to activity. All the rules and T2V put new users off.

We've had multiple people leave because of the quality of the sub. 

Even though the rules are over complicated once you get them they aren't hard to understand. It's probably just overwhelming for a newbie.
