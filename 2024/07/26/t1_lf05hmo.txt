Not just exhaustion PopsNut. I think it's something to do with intimidation. People who have received less than 500 tips this round will definitely not want to grind any further when they see others are far ahead with 2k+. Thankfully I will be ending this round with 1.5k+ tips. It's an improvement from the 200 tips I got last round.
