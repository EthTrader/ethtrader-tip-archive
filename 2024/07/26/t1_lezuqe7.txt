What do people actually mean 'better quality'?

I think it actually just means more original content post? To be honest with you it also depends on activity of the sub, if there are only 10 active users people aren't going to spend 2 hours making 1 post

I did make a lot of original airdrop posts when the sub was a lot more active. Nowadays it is no longer worth the effort and demoralising to see high-effort posts only get 20-30 comments in the end
