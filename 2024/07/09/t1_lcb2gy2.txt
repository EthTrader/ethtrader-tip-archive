We have been in a bull market for a good 18 months now.

Looks at BTC over the last 18 months - look at it's dominance having risen, and look at the overall growth. This is merely the correction before the post-halving euphoric peak.

By the time we start calling it a real bull run, that's the time to sell, as we will be near the peak.
