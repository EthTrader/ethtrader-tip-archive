I'd disagree - we don't need more supply inflation.

I wouldn't go for a 50/50 split though, EthTrader is first and foremost the origin of DONUT.

Yes, it needs a lot of thinking, rules, structure, moderation and of course reward allocation. But I would support taking a portion of our rewards from this sub to reward cryptotrader.

Increasing supply inflation would just further devalue the token.
