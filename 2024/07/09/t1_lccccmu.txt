At this point we are at a market cap of $1,492,806 and a price of $0.006772.

I don't think we'll fall far below that. We had already reached a price of 6c and held it at 3c for a long time. In terms of winning prospects, it's up to 3c or x4. What other coin can you do this with? 

I still didn't sell at 6c because I see far more potential and Donut can quickly go through the roof if someone like Elon Musk (who eats a donut almost every day and loves them more than anything) talks about it. If we find more application Vitalik Buterin might also mention Donut, as it also runs on the Arbitrum chain, which he values ​​very much.
