To me they are choosing the path of dillution. I will be happy to get my fees back and a bit more, hopefully. We will probably be eligible for something like 500 LXP after this campaign, so my guess is that if they really want to make LXP still valuable, the next campaigns (hopefully there aren't any, ofc) need to give much less than 500 LXP. They could also use LXP values tiers (maybe like $JITO with their point system?)
