Sharp uptick in comments after t2v is surely in part accounted by all the tip comments, at least a third of the daily comments are the hidden tip comments. I know it looks busier but look at the people posting, it's the same people all day every day, I lurk and have seen like 3 new people and 2 older ones come back.
