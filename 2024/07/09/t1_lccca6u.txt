Interesting, ratio vs price. 

Higher ratio attracts people to farm. This round the ratio was high so the farmers are farming extra hard, but the farmers rarely if ever buy any, and the farmers are the ones who often dump their free bags because that's the aim. 

So I would personally say a high ratio is probably bad, because it seems to draw in the farmers hoping to get paid, who are in turn all just waiting to sell their freebies at an opportune time.
