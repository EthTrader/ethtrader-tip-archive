ETFs definitely won't create significant buying pressure imho. We've already witnessed this with BTC. 

The only factor here would be ETH being used as a platform rather than just an asset if we want to see an increase in liquidity. I'm betting big on Ethereum being used for RWAs and DePins in the coming years. That would substantially change the landscape.

Alsongiven how small the overall crypto marketcap is compared to other asset class, we still have plenty of room to grow.
