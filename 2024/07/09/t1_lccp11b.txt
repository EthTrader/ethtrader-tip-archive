Bullish. Lower interest rates make borrowing  cheaper and saving less attractive, which can increase the overall  liquidity in the market. More liquidity means more money is available for investment.

When interest rates are low, traditional safe investments like savings accounts and bonds offer lower returns. This will make investors look for higher returns in riskier assets, like eth.  This can bring more capital into the crypto market.

Also, interest rate cuts can lead to a weaker USD. Crypto is a hedge against dollar weakness. As the value of the dollar  decreases, the value of crypto can stabilize against it, or, best case  scenario, increase as investors look for alternative stores of value.

If the interest rates are lower, it can lead to higher inflation. Once again, crypto is considered as a hedge against inflation, mostly due to the limited supply.
