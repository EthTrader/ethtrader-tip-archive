I fail to see how Labour winning is a good thing for crypto in the UK. The Labour Party never shared a detailed stance on crypto. As a matter of fact, the left is known for absolutely hating crypto. "Showing openness to related technologies" isn't exactly specific.

Rachel Reeves showed support for the tech sector, but the tech sector is pretty wide. Doesn't have to necessarily incorporate crypto in this case. The only particular thing they said about crypto was when Tulip Siddiq stated that Labour "could transform the UK into a global hub for tokenized assets". Could, may, might, again nothing that could really "renew crypto industry optimism".

For reference, I am not affiliated with any party, nor are my political beliefs in question here. But I honestly can't understand how the Labour Party's victory positively affects the crypto industry directly, which is what this article states.
