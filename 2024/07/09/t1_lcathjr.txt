To answer your post:

I trade these memecoins with the same risk management rules as I would with my other trading. Memecoins are risky even with high conviction plays, which is why I don't risk a large portion of my portfolio on each trade.

I have a clear strategy, and that was it doesn't feel like gambling because I have conviction in my edge.

...but at end of the day, any type of trading is like gambling.

Nice post btw !tip 2
