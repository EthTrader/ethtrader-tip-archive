I like the new sub thing a lot but where’s the Donut distri gonna ”come” from? That’s the one thing I’m not sure about… I reckon many wouldn’t want to see ethtraders’ distributed donut amount drastically lowered as a result of the sister sub.

Maybe it should also be further discussed and perhaps even voted on?
