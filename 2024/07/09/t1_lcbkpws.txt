Seeing as you want to dissect this... i would say Shitcoins and Memecoins are like thumbs and fingers.

All memecoins are shitcoins, but not all shitcoins are memecoins.


Safemoon. a shitcoin... not a memecoin. They tried to have a use case, they tried to be something... they were just a shit scam.

FLOKI. It's a shitcoin... it's a memecoin, it's just a copy-cat of DOGE, the original meme.

I'd say the difference between a Memecoin and a Shitcoin is their intent, but they are all still shitcoins IMO.
