I like visiting this sub and hold a lot of Donuts obviously but I can't see why anyone would buy any, the past few times were accidents. 

If anyone can come up with any solid reasons to buy any I'll consider buying some. I've been here nearly a year and can't see why you'd buy half a governance token when it doesn't let you govern anything, I know and don't care why, but buying Donut alone does nothing without contrib. 

I'm going away with work next week and I won't be online for a while for a few weeks, if anyone can convince me to buy some I formally promise to spend at least a hundred quid or something, it'll pump all'a y'all by a few pips at least. 

Oh and I have to agree with the reasons, you can't just say buy because I like them or because they have potential or because they might get a listing (they won't)
