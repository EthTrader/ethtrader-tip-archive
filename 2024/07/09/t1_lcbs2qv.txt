I don't know about y'all but anycoin that was created as a joke is just a memecoins to me. Shitcoins are coins that doesn't perform well and goes to shit, LUNA is a good example for me. But meme coins are just a joke coin with meme like avatar. Doge, shiba, wakanda, even most RCPs are memecoins in my book. Any coin can be shitty if they perform awfully !tip 1Â
