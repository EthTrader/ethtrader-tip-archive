I like the idea - I joked previously about "cryptotrader" - but it'd be cool to see it happen.

I just hope, if supported, it's implemented properly.

No point making r/cryptotrader and just being a shitty unpopular version of "r/cryptocurrency" - EthTrader already has become a spamfest of low quality news links rather than Trading analysis or ideas.

Mods already seem to be spread pretty thin in this sub, let alone adding another.

I'd support this, but I hope it's not rushed - I feel like we still need to work on this sub first as a priority.
