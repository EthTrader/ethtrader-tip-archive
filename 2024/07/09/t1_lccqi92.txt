So many incredible L2 solutions are currently being built, that i can imagine we will soon see some very good real world usecases of L2's.

Dencun made it possible. One transaction is very cheap nowadays.

Because of this i look on the big picture - i will hodl my ETH until 2030 atleast, no matter what happens. If we go up or down. In the meantime i will buy as much ETH as i can until a certain barrier.

I don't want to miss out on the second Bitcoin again.

Thats why i think we will see $10k by 2030.
