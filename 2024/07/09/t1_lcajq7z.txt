> This looks like yet another rushed implementation

Agree. I'm happy to vote yes if this simply means let's go ahead and then do the ground work to do it properly - which I think also means having more structure for this sub first.

I'd be voting NO if this means, let's get it up and running in 2-3 months.


I'd also suggest rules in place also need to speak down to "trader" at iit's core, otherwise what's "cryptotrader" going to be, just a shitty version of "cryptocurrency" for all the banned users?

EthTrader already seems to be a home for low quality general news links and has steered far away fromm "EthTraders" original core vision.

I like the idea - but I hope it's done properly.
