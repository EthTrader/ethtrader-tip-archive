Ridiculous

If you are going to remove posts based on ‘they could be questions on the daily’, please remove every single original content post

Make this sub 100% full of news repost which require even less effort and 0 effort. 

At the moment it seems like only a few BroNuts ORIGINAL CONTENT posts are being removed. Mind you, we are being penalised for coming out with original thought and based on one mod’s discretion whether it is ‘good enough’ or not

I think only a few users are being affected at the moment. Based on a rule that is totally up to mod’s discretion. I think we should remove this rule altogether with such ambiguity.
