>Will Trump Be in Jail Before Election Day?

If Trump spends at least 48 consecutive hours in custody in a jail or prison prior to the election in November, “yes” voters in this pool will win a payout. This pool has been in place since January of this year and the odds of a “yes” outcome have climbed as high as 25%, though they are currently just 5%. Over $1.4 million rides on this outcome.

Lmao 😂
