Users are going to need to read all the proposals and vote for the ones they believe fits best.

For example, you could have 2 conflicting proposals regarding news links specifically, one for 0.5x and one for 0.75x. The one that is implemented is the one that has the most support. 

Other times, proposals can syngerise with each other.
