Some people simply don't care for DONUT. Especially those who come here every so often but mostly hang out in EthFinance, which is basically the "fork" of this sub, without Token Governance.

Some users might only make a couple of comments here a month and frequent other subs like Bitcoin, Ethereum, but they've seen 1 decent post worth commenting in, or something they want to passionately debunk.

And as others have said, especially in political posts... bots and users who are only here because of politics.
