> Maybe minimum character requirement for posts like in r/cc

But with character/words counts, also exclude "fluff or "filler" words... If you're adding text like "hi bronuts, I hope you're having a good day, I just wanted to make this post to ask a question" - or, "let me know your thoughts in the comments below" - would absolutely be considered filler text.

If the primary point of the post comes back to a very simple, generic question, then it should be referred to the daily.
