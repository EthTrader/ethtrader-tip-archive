The discretion of mods is sometimes necessary, but the main problem I see here is the shortage of mods. We currently have only two mods handling content moderation. Also, as DBRiMatt mentioned, there should have been clear guidelines about it.  
  
I have been working on two proposals that might be able to tackle this issue to some extent.
