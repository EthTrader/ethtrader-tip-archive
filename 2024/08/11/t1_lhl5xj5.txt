The problem is that who will be there to determine the boundary of whether it is a question or a discussion - imo it will still fall into the hands of mods, too much discretion and too much grey area

If this passes we need to set clear boundaries as to what will be a question and what is a discussion. If not it’ll just add on to the confusion and the unhappiness we’ve seen with this whole debacle of whether something should be in a daily or not recently
