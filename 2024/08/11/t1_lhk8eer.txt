I don't bother tipping posts if I believe they will get deleted - quickly reading articles you can begin to easily identify when posts are paid shills, duplicate content or competing alt-coins. Sometimes I get it wrong and still tip posts that eventually get removed, but it doesn't take long to get better at identifying them.
