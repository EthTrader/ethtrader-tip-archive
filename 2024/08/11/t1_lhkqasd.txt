>This situation led to forced sales at a loss. Following the market drop, Fickel struggled to maintain his risky position and had to cut his losses. In the last 10 hours, he sold 10,000 ETH to reduce his debt. This sale was used to repay approximately 425.75 WBTC worth around 26 million dollars. However, this move was not enough to completely close Fickelâ€™s long position on the ETH/BTC pair.
