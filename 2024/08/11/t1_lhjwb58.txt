I don't know man, I'm sick of it. you send a modmail and you got ignored or replied after 4 days, and in the meantime snapshot on posts get taken and even if they re-approve it, the damage is done and you pay the pay2post fee without getting thee tipping bonus.

it took u/AltruisticPops 3 days to get an answer from mods and only because some of us tagged mods several time here in the daily.

there is only 1 mod active, beside aminok, and this sub can't be managed this way

this sub has no hopes, we are digging our hole into the ground
