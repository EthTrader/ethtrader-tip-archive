In this case it seems like the sell off has occurred before-hand, almost tentatively just in case the migration doesn't work out.

From memory there was a bit of a sell off before the ETH merge transition to proof of stake as well - and followed by no immediate price action. But some people bought back in after seeing it worked out ok.
