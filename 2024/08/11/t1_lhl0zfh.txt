If news will be 0.75x then this proposal makes sence.

If news will stay 1.0x and you need to write 200 words for the same ratio 1.0x then we donÂ´t support self written posts.

I also made a proposal for 1.5x for text posts (market price analysis excluded), 250-499 words.

It really depends on what will happen...

I will vote for news 0.75x proposal first, and will vote for this later.
