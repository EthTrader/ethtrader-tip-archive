I've seen CDC has created another level card for rewards... a bull run is coming!!

CDC support might make some amateur mistakes by sending too many funds to users (noobs)

But their executive team arn't dumb. They were the first to slash rewards "earn rewards" and card benefits months before anyone else started to, before we really confirmed we were in a bear market.

A bull run is coming, and CDC can smell it!
