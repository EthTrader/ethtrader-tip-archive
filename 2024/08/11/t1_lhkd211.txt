Fyi, my point about making it fixed vs discretionary also fits your purpose of 'detailed explanation' - because currently it is very uncertain when you leave everything up to a mod's discretion on what is acceptable vs what is clearly defined in a rule book (which is my approach - put it in a rule what is acceptable, and not leave it up to a single person's opinion)

Also, I believe the trust is starting to be broken between members and moderating - so personally I don't think the approach of relying on mod discretion is better compared to moderating based on fixed rules. Starting to see the cracks now and can only imagine it getting worse with more conflicts if this does not get addressed.

'This sub is on average, approximately 100 posts submitted every day, which starts to add up for a large work-load for 1 person.' - I agree - which is why with fixed parameters, mods can more easily moderate the sub, and people will be a lot less surprised when their posts get removed instead of wondering why. Wherever there is a gap, I trust members to address them through poll and others to approve- this has been a method which has worked so far and our poll system is a lot more active than r/cc .

Appreciate the difference in opinion tho!
