I think this is the point. These posts should be removed for being low effort. 

But this is allowing them to remain. Low effort posts arn't going to be spammed by farmers, because it's not "worth it" - but users who arn't farming, possibly even unregistered users, who simply want to ask a simple question - will not get their post removed for doing so.
