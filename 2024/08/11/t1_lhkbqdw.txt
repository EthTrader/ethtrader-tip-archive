I'm going to say [NO] here;

I think the opposite is needed; I think we need more **detailed Expanded rules**, similar to that of r/cryptocurrency

Expanded rules with better definitions and examples actually assist in reducing room for interpretation when compared to unclear basic rules and guidelines.

Better defined will help simplify things for users and mods - without reverting back to the low quality spam we had months ago. Let's not undo the good work and take a step backwards, but instead make additions to continue forward.

I also think we need atleast 1 more active mod who's role is to assist in content curation, and with collaboration those "discretionary" calls will be more transparent with multiple mods in agreeance.

This sub is on average, approximately 100 posts submitted every day, which starts to add up for a large work-load for 1 person.
