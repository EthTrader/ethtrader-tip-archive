Even though the title is a question, the post is filled with information and opens a space for discussion. Personally i would go with a "Discussion" flair.

If the post was just "Hey, ARB is unlocking tokens every week, will you still buy it?" I would go with a Question flair.

Mods will still have to take decisions on some posts. Nothing can be black and white even if you lay down a thousand rules. Some of the things will always be open to interpretation.
