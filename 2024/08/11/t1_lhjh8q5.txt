Just my feelings on this, there’s no more Downvoting problem, great, but the WORST part of this sub right now - and I think if you ask most BroNuts who are not in the discord channel this they will say is the moderating and waking up to ‘removed post’ because certain mods are trigger happy

Some are justified duplicates, but a lot of these removals are based on discretion - if you post about a development on a certain big news, it can get removed even if it is not identical. 

And this ‘It should be a daily comment’ shit? It is basically saying ‘it’s my opinion’, so it’s a ‘It’s up to my power’ kind of shit. There is absolutely zero justification why an original post should be removed just based on the whims and feelings of certain mods on this ridiculous rule while News reposts which take zero effort 10 seconds to post make up 90% of the sub , why don’t they just Nuke everyone’s posts this way and just make this a news sub then
