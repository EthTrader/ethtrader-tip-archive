Wouldn't buy any, but I'm glad receiving ARB incentives + APR for liquidity I provide/supply in different protocols. Same case for OP. The ecosystem is really good and once all tokens have been fully unlocked incentives will have to come from somewhere, thus implying buybacks. Also, it will be easier to reward token holders if staking comes, which could imply diffrent ways of promoting ecosystem incentives (for example oARB rewards from Dolomite, which allow you to buy ARB tokens for a discount of up to 100% from market price under certain conditions). New features will have to come if Arbitrum wants to compete with upcoming L2s and L3s, so bullish long term, but maybe loading up on ARB right now is tricky.
