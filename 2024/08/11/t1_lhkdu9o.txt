>my point about making it fixed vs discretionary also fits your purpose of 'detailed explanation' - because currently it is very uncertain when you leave everything up to a mod's discretion on what is acceptable vs what is clearly defined in a rule book 

I think there still needs to be some room for discretion because it will be impossible to account for EVERY possible example in expanded rules.

And I feel like we might have some similarity in our vision of what we would like the sub to look like, but I think instead of straight away going to the guts of 'remove discretion' we add detailed expanded rules first - this specific proposal on it's own is only removing the 'discretionary' factor without offering any other quality control measures.

I would suggest, first and foremost, we devise the detailed expanded rules, which will then provide more clarity and reduce the 'discretionary" factor on the majority of removals.

I would support spending the rest of this round establishing expanded clear rules and guidelines to achieve the similar result as the wording of this proposal.

>Also, I believe the trust is starting to be broken between members and moderating - so personally I don't think the approach of relying on mod discretion is better compared to moderating based on fixed rules.

Unfortunately some users will take things personally, get emotional and then it's just a snowball affect.
