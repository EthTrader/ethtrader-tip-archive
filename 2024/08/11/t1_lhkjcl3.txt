Yes, I did mention that minimum character should be implemented and I think that such measures will be approved quickly 

Imo any obvious ‘gaps’ would be easily spotted and we are a lot quicker to implement these new measures compared to r/cc - a much higher proportion of members make polls here compared to cc sub

My personal opinion is that we shouldn’t make a small or minor inconvenience which can be easily addressed take away from the bigger issue at play here
