No, alts are for selling when cycle ATHs come and with that profit you buy BTC and maybe ETH (I believe ETH will become more stable next cycle).

Another strategy is to sell all, hold all that money in stablecoins and buy the bottom again next cycle.

Unpopular opinion: Timing the Winter bottom range is not that hard. Plenty of time to buy really cheap.

My suggestion: Patiently waiting until BTC does a 60% down and then start DCAing increasing the amount the lower it goes and decreasing the higher it goes.
