If you're buying ARB for the first time in the next 2 months or so, you'll probably do quite well. Yes, there have been lots of unlocks already, which is why price is low. Yes, there are more unlocks to come. But a bull run can actually overwhelm the impact of supply unlocks in a short term. I'd say anyone with an average cost under 80c will be looking very happy in about 9 months time.
