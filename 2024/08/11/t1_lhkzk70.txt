Yeh, thats why some clarity can help. It's not always about the title, but the content of the post.

I like this as a post, and I would keep it as a discussion flair. Even though the title is a basic question, and it has a simple question at the end, the post contains relevent background information that makes it a more open discussion, rather than a basic question - in my opinion. 

However, if you exclude the words citing the source, and the question itself - it's only 184 words - technically not meeting the discussion flair standards. 

What flair would you give it if your two proposals pass?
