Personally, I would have allowed that one for the type of discussion that generated.

But, I number of 'comments and engagement' is a not good metric to decide what should be a post or not. 

I could make a post "What alts are you buying?" and could potentially get hundreds of comments, but that doesn't mean it should be a post. "Did you buy the dip?" would be another example, could gain a lot of comments, but really is a question that should be asked in the daily.
