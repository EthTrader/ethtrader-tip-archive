>And this ‘It should be a daily comment’ shit? It is basically saying ‘it’s my opinion’, so it’s a ‘It’s up to my power’ kind of shit

This is where I feel there needs to be atleast 1 more active mod who's role is to actively moderate submissions, so moderation can be a more collaborative effort, similar to how r/cc operates. When multiple mods are in agreeance a post does not meet content standards than it's no longer questionable. 

Fair chance news links will receive a multiplier nerf next round. But perhaps we should look at a "question" flair with a multiplier nerf as well, so posts like "What alts are you buying?" are on par with self story multipliers.

But again, to repeat, in your posts situation, I would say that was an acceptable post for discussion.
