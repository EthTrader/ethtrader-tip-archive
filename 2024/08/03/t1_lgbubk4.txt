That killed it for me. I bought into it early, made some gains but then also hodl'd too long on the remainder. Having good tokenomics and then just changing them when you approach your max supply looks at worst fishy to me. And at best it looks as if you haven't planned your tokenomics properly at the start.  !tip 1
