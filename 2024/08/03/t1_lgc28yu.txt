I don't mean this in a bad way. But take some responsibility and stop crying. I was told doesn't exist in this game. It's a highly speculative asset & you shouldn't put in more than you're okay losing. 

I wish you well, and hope you recover from any losses & don't get overwhelmed by negative emotions. But just stick to some S&P ETF and bonds if this is too much for you.
