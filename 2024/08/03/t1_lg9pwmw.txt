Its interesting how asset classes that were created to hedge against inflation and are expected to gain value during recessions (or fears of recession) are now being affected by these very conditions. 

It might still take a long time for BTC and ETH to shed their reputation as risky and volatile assets.

Personally i will be buying those two whenever there is a discount.
