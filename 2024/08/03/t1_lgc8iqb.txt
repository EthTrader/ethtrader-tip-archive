I understand what you're saying, but I saw one of your comment on the BTC sub too and it seems to me you can't bear this, you seems to emotional for all this.

you just entered at the peak of the previous bullrun, that's it. You were exit liquidity for someone who was earlier than you.

if you wait, and you put the money in solid project, someone else in the future could be your exit liquidity this time, but if you tell you can lose sanity in the meantime, please consider some alternative, cause at the end of the day this game has to improve your life, not the opposite
