No, the mods arn't "evil bad man" trying to "steal peoples donuts". They are removing low effort junk that should be submissions in the daily, not the front page. This question flair will also mean that low effort questions, instead of getting removed, will simply have a flair multiplier penalty, which still allows users to earn some DONUT, versus none at all.
