That was possible when special memberships were directly inbuilt to the Reddit Platform, but that is not a thing anymore.

I'd suggest things like 500k+ users get first invites to beta-test/trial new things - or, 250k+ users are eligible for airdrops/donations from sponsors that rent the banner etc.

For example, let's say Ledger host an AMA with a $500 USDC giveaway.  $100 could be divvied up amongst 250k+ users who ask a question, while $400 are divvied up amongst the best questions.
