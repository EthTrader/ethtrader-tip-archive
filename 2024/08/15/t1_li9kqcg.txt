people would just do work arrounds, and im not saying mods are bad... they are doing a good job, but they are sometimes Biased aswell towards some users. similar posts will be allowerd/removed based on who the OP is.  if you are disliked by one of the mods, it could be flagged low effort but wont be if you are a good friend of all the mods.

Example: 1 "standard" member of the sub who is well known in the crypto verse that does dislike you or starts to do so, could easily affect others wiew on you by causing trouble or giving you blame for stuff.  

Now it only takes 1 mod to be affected by the lies or trash talk, and all of a sudden your posts gets nuked or penalised as low effort, while the rest can keep posting same kinds of discussion posts, strategy posts with 99% similarity or lenght and thats totally fine. 

Personally I dont dislike the mods, but i have experienced this very thing happen by a certaub member here and im now blocked on discord and my posts much more often gets penalised as low effort even if it matches a lot of other posts in setup.  (not identical or same topic but with same kind of setup when it comes to the post itself)

if it becomes a thing, i would just not post any kinds of discussion or strategy posts wich could be interpited as a question in any ways.
