Yeah I can't talk about your case in particular and/if any injustice has been done (I see many popular users getting posts removed all the time and it happens to me as well) but I agree that I'd like to have less discretion and more clear rules personally. As in for example a "Short Question" flair for under 100 words which contains all the small questions or low effort questions that merit a 0.1 multiplier and a Question flair for longer ones for example.

But if it'll work out as u/DBRiMatt said I'd still be fine if mods recognize that a title with a question can very well induce a proper discussion and thus receive the appropriate Discussion flair. I personally think that this should somehow made be clear to the mod team or included in the proposal itself.  !tip 1
