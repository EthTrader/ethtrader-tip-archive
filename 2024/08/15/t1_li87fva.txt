Never seen more than 1k - 2k online, ever. Most accounts are dead, also someone said that even deleted/suspended accounts still show as members. Which makes sense as there's never been a fraction of 1% of those 2.3m people here at one time. It's also been at 2.3m for a long long time without much growth, active members dropped massively obviously.
