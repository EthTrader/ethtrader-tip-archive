I didn't want to suggest that and didn't have any bad experience with mods in that regard. I just wasn't sure how rigid they'd take the rule. So you'd say that a post that has a question as a title and tries to induce a debate and meaningful discussion wouldn't get removed with that new rule? That's actually all I want. I completely agree that "how was your day in crypto today" should get a 0.1 mult. I genuinely want to help and prevent future issues, that's all. !tip 1
