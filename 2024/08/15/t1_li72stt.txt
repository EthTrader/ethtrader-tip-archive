Too many disengeuine users farming. When users are tipping low quality content or replying to posts with "interesting OP !tip1" while it's painfully obvious they either didn't read it, or didn't understand it.

And thats okay to not understand something, this should be a place users can learn. But, you'd think after a few years of participating in crypto subs, users would be able to offer some genuine and authentic discussion. 

That's what I found a lot in r/cc - so many users farming and not understanding simple basics of crypto, an d that's ok, but they did not want to even bother learning the basics of crypto, and that was obvious in their comments.
