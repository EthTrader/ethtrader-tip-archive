>  I think there could be ways to find a middle ground and reduce the multiplier of "short-questions" for example but straight up nuking EVERY question based on the low quality ones seems overkill for me.

Content standards can differentiate what a question is versus an invitation for discussion.

Funnily enough, I input r/cc's content guidelines into ChatGPT - and asked if that question post should be deleted, it said no. 

The point of the question flair is to prevent low effort general questions being spammed as posts.
