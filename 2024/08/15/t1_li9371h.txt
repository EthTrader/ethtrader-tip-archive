Hmmm I'd be afraid to use anything with a question mark at the end since it sounds pretty subjective to determine what passes these standards and what not. I guess my post example still should be considered a question and the correct flair would be question and not discussion. Idk. I'm completely fine with low effort questions receiving a 0.1 multiplier but sophisticated and well redacted questions that invite to further debate are still questions and would likely receive that same flair !tip 1
