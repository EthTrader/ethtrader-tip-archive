>Ethereum (ETH) saw a 1.7% drop on Wednesday, despite positive signs like declining US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation and significant inflows into Ethereum ETFs. The lower CPI, which fell to 2.9%, year-on-year

Currently I still think the outflows of Ethereum is much more than the inflow and the lower CPI we got, I doubt the price gonna be high anytime soon
