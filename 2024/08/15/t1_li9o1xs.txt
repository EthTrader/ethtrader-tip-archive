Yes. My personal experience here is not important when it comes to voting: my point is if there is no clear rules or the rules are: mods Will handle it, the biased Googles Will be on and some competetive members Will do anything to affect the wiew of others when it comes to the people They dislike. 

Karma is a bitch some times, the guy who worked so hard to penalize me Got hacked and lost his bags. So now we both Got shitty returns from our efforts. 🤷‍♂️

We actually worked it out Long Time ago, Idk why he started up again because Ive been trying to Lay low. Its like Im his personal punching bag. 👀

Anyways: clear guidelines and automation would be the key to victory here i Think.
