Way less posts there but as someone has already pointed out that will partially be due to the topic limiter. There will be posts getting removed all the time that people don't see 

The difference in posts is on here everyone will comment on a post whether they care about it or not. Probably because of T2V

On rcc if users aren't interested in a post they scroll past it. The popular posts people are interested in end up with 100's of comments. You must see them too HuntNut I see you on there!
