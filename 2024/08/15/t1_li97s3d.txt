Yes, exactly.

It is subjective, but if a post is inciting meaningful discussion, it will be a discussion. If the post is a simple question, it will be a question.

What is your sell-point for ETH? What is your favorite wallet and why? What alt coins are you buying?

All very different to, "How does EIP-1559, with it's fee burning mechanism, affect the long term economics of ETH and what are the broader implications for its role as a potential store or value due to its potential deflationary nature?

Your question involves a technical + economic discussion, isn't a simple self-story question or a basic/simple general question - therefore, promotes inciteful/objective discussion.
