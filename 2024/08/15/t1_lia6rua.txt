Yeah I know what you mean man it doesn't make sense sometimes 

I just try to focus on the size of my bags and watching them grow. There's constantly stuff that pump like crazy but chasing those can be a fast track to getting rekt as well 

Still allow yourself some funds to throw at gambles like that but don't go balls deep 

Were you close to buying this stock then?
