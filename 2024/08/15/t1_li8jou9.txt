>I bought APE coin back then and losy half of my money (deserved)

You're brutally honest with yourself lmao. I never bought ape coins and will never believe in it but I just know the developers are working very hard to make sure the coin shouldn't be ded and apecoin is better than most memecoins out there because it's an utility to those holding apes. If I remember correctly, it was airdrops to most ape holders
