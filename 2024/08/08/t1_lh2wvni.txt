No. The 6c was accidental anyway, shillers falsely believed moons and donuts were adjacent exposures to the reddit IPO because they did not realize reddit abandoned rcps. They were totally wrong which is why we dropped 90% since then.


I like donuts, 99% of members are awesome but there's no reason to buy any and there's a close to 0% chance at a cex listing and profits. Best bet is hoping eth goes up and we get dragged.Â 


The people are not stupid and the market is not wrong, a 90% loss speaks for itself. Projects with real potential tend to go up.
