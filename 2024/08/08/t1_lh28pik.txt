>The total value locked (TVL) in Blast has reached approximately $847 million according to DefiLlama, though Blast's own site reports over $1.4 billion. This discrepancy highlights different methodologies in calculating TVL.

How convenient! They added a few millions to get their TVL up to $1.4bn. 
I'll go with DeFiLama's $847m. Still impressive though.
