>Congrats on getting rewards! I completely missed Izumi's airdrop of ZK... turns out I only had 210 pts with them anyway, so I might not have even qualified.

Sorry, I misunderstood what you wrote earlier. I was talking about their LP rewards.
I didn't get any ZK tokens. Still mad at them for that.

>I'm earning some points with them on Scroll Network though - so shall see what happens with that.. 

You doing anything with Scroll or Linea?

Nah, I'm totally done with airdrops. I just buy tokens and stake.

Sorry for the mix up.
