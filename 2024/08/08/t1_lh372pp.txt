Nope

Congrats on getting rewards! I completely missed Izumi's airdrop of ZK... turns out I only had 210 pts with them anyway, so I might not have even qualified.

I'm earning some points with them on Scroll Network though - so shall see what happens with that.. 

You doing anything with Scroll or Linea?
