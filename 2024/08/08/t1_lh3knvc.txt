Yeah I agree. Metamask has this unique layer ls setup that makes it different from all those other wallets out there. It's not just a newbies get to go wallet. I remember when I was new to crypto, I hated metamask myself because I don't understand it but with metamask, you'll have to understand how to import your tokens, what's smart contract, what' chain you needed and so on. 

Metamask still the best non custodian wallet out there but the app version just kinda took heavy. So wallet like safepal, coinbase wallet or kraken wallet is good for mobile
