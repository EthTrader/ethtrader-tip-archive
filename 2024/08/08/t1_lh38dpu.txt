Ah yep. Yeh, Initially I spoke of the LP rewards, but then your comment made me remember hearing that some dex's would pass airdrop rewards to users too, and that I forgot to check Izumi. 

KOI are using their ZK airdrop allocation to incentivize Liquidity Positions, and fuck knows what Syncswap are doing with theirs!
