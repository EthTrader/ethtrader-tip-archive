This is the greatest transfer of wealth in all time from poor to rich, years of deliberate austerity and the entire p*ndemic situation. My question is that now energy companies have all the money and resources and have enforced these cost of living rises with no end in sight, what is the actual plan now?


The whole world is tightly controlled, the 0.1% have 99% of the money, we're constantly fed a stream of dispicable lies and propaganda ultimately leading to a perpetual state of fear and anxiety. Great, mission accomplished, you control everything, nobody realizes fear is deliberate and now you have all the money too. Now what?! What's the end game here? ðŸ˜‚ suffer for decades, world war?! ðŸ˜‚Â
