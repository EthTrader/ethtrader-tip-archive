Oh it's the Reddit shitty app. The app sucks a lot. Sometimes it duplicate your comments. While typing now, my phone told me "REDDit app not responding"

I always give them 1star every update they make on play store. I usually use the website to comment but uses the app for replying my notifications.

If you use the website, you'll definitely love it than the app. I guess that's the reason why people use the 3rd party app bcos this Reddit app is shit
