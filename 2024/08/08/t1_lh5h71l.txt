A lesson I learned a bit too late. I had such high expectations for $Arb. My average cost is like $1.80 and now I’m holding a heavy bag.

The network is great, it’s the best in the L2 market. The team is also incredibly amazing and supportive. But the coin, idk anymore. Tokenomics are just not it.

Even $Brick has better tokenomics, god forbid.
