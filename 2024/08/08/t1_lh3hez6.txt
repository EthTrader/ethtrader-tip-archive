>At least no one can just simply use to it seedphrase and log in your wallet

Yeah they won't be able to login into metamask with the seed phrases because of 2FA but they're some other non custodian wallet which doesn't require 2FA to access. It's a good thing from metamask though to keep your wallet secure which will booster other wallets to follow suit if it's successful.
