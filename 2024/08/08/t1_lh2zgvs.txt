There's one amazing thing from all this and it's a surefire reminder that no matter how positive or how much we rally around and hope for $1 and all that, it means nothing, and it does nothing for the price. Tens and tens of thousands of mindlessly positive comments and sentiment over the year and we still got handed a 90% loss.Â 


This is such a powerful lesson in the observable and undeniable inefficacy of hopes and prayers. I'm glad we're learning a bit!
