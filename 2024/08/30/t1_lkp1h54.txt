Ahh I see what the problem is looking at your post history. When you post links you don't embed the link you put the link in the post itself 

AutoMod is thinking your posts are text posts and not meeting the minimum word count. Embed the link instead moving forward to avoid it!

Hopefully those will be reinstated though as it is just a link!
