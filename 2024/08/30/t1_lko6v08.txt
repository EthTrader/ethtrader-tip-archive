Sorry BigFred. The trick is to search for individual keywords in the article. Take this headline for instance: **Nigerian SEC Issues First Crypto Exchange Licenses After Industry Crackdown**

Search for **Licenses**

Search for **Exchange**

Search **Nigeria**

Search **SEC**

Any of the above individual searches using filters of **Today** or **This Week** will reveal if the article has been posted or not.
