>A CryptoQuant analyst highlighted a significant Ethereum trend, noting that Ethereum's price staying above its Realized Price (RP) could signal the start of an altcoin bull run. Historically, when Ethereum's price is above its RP, it indicates most ETH holders are in profit, reducing selling pressure and boosting investor confidence.

As far as I want an hopium for ETH, I find it hard to believe whatever analyst are saying. They are they ones saying 10k ETH last bull which never happened. They always saying analysis to pump their damn bags
