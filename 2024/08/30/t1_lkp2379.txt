I would assume news about polymarket platform would be acceptable, being an ethereum based dapp; but if the focus of the article is about a specific bet, then it's not about ethereum or macro.

Eg. Polymarket sees 100M volume this week is on topic about an ethereum based protocol

User loses 50k betting on election results would not be on topic, the news is not ethereum related, nor macro
