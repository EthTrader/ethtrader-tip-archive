You can actually do whatever you want tbh. If I tell you to go in all on ETH and the price dip more, won't you think the advice I gave you is bad? Just do whatever you want to do and move with it 

Try look at Ethereum chart since it launches and to this date and you'll have a clue if buying 1eth is worth it or you shouldn't
