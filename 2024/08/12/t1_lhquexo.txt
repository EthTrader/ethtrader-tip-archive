What is frustrating is all the large institutional holders that suddenly have to dump for whatever reason... Like right now we know grayscale is going to dump, jump crypto took stupid risks and had to liquidate, chart in general looks like dog shit and who knows what governments will dump their eth holdings too.

We simply have more hurdles that have to be cleared before we can be bullish again, but it will happen at some point. So enjoy the discount in the meantime.
