According to this article it seems like little effort was put into  an actual meetup and it was more like a half baked presentation. That's a total screwup on the part of Kamala's campaign. And as usual, it's sad to see articles use sensationalism to make it seem as though crypto was the issue when the issue was the people themselves. 

*Fun fact, 90% of the problems in crypto are the people themselves and not the actual product*.
