I'm pretty sure I'll fall into the "receive slightly more than I send" category, but I also don't blindly tip every single post that is published. I don't tip posts that I'm confident will be removed for being duplicates or off-topic.

It would be interesting to see what other patterns you have detected with your data analysis!
