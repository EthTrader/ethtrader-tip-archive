I have a small portion of my ETH on Etherfi.

There is always risks to staking, restaking etc. To mitigate risks, I tend to diversify and use multiple wallets.

Eg. Wallet 1 = some ETH on Etherfi

Wallet 2 = some ETH with Everstake

etc.

So far I've never had any issues with being rugged, phished or exploited, but if I do, I know that I'll only ever lose a portion.
