Yes. I think investors watching donut trains or tip spam chains would not invest in donut. 

Those who are abusing probably don’t care about the peoject or token anyways, it’s likely just a quick paycheck. 

Don’t get me wrong, trading and selling is okey. 

But abuse just to earn more and sell more is not okey in my book.
