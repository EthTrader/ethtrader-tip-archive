Yeah people obviously have very very high average buy prices, and if you do it means you've only been here a few years tops as in 2019 eth was below $1k meaning people from that time are sitting on 2,5x even with this dip.. It's like a way to indirectly tell people you either bought high and didn't dca down, or that you are very new.
