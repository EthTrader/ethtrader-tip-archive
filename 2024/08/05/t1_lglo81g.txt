Hah, thatâ€™s probably why I felt this distribution round was unsatisfying. -18, ouch. ðŸ˜…

In the end, Iâ€™m here for Ethereum and this project. Should farmers completely take over i would be sad for the donut project but my life would go on. ðŸ˜…

Donut is not looking sweet to buy right now with these issues. And tbh real users are probably leaving with the massive abuses we have had for over a year now. 

Iâ€™m painting a target on my back for saying so, but -18 shows they already know Iâ€™m against abuse. ðŸ˜‚
