I hope I dont get heat for giving my opinion.

Im.ot from the US but I like geopolitics and I'm up to date with it.

I don't like democrats and anything they represent. The country is in shity shape (I'll not name what, just look for yourself). I want a change over there as it impacts whole world.

I'd vote for republicans. Not only because Trump supports crypto (he is a politician at the end of the day) but the guy is a business man and knows money. Like it or not.

I don't agree with all his politics but I don't think, crypto/economic wise, it can get worse than currently.

So out with the democrats and the shady hypocrisy from Pelosi and Warren and all their gang.
