Was a weird inflow of strange users being overly negative... Checked some of them .. and seems to be puking garbage all over trading reddit subs, guess the goal was to incur a larger selloff.  

Kind of weird if that's just eager traders pushing prices down.. bots? 

This guy fighting ice was a great example
