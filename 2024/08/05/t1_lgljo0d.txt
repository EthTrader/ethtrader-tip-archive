Yes and no.

I Think a lot of people started shorting ETH just like stocks as a sell the news thing after ETF launch, and the grayscale ETFâ€™s made a sell off. 

Bear traders entered and Stock markets are not doing Well atm.

And then some news about the US economy Giving the whales all the tools/info They need to sell to stables. 

Markets were allready in a Down trend and people are leveraging in a bearish Way. 

Just dont panic sell! ðŸ˜… Thats what Im telling myself.
