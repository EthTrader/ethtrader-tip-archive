I like to think even though Im not ICO early - Im still early to a degree. A few years ago we didnt have ETFs or institutions involved. We didnt have politicians talking about crypto and now its one of the biggest topics in this years elections. Im not delusional and like to keep my expectations real with that said I think most of us are early. Ive been doing daily DCA for almost 4 years now and am already in profit both on my ETH and BTC. I will consider DCA out after ETH goes near $6000 and BTC like $90 000 !tip 1
