From source:

*The High Court of Hong Kong ordered the disclosure of financial details of the operation of Mantra Chain in the dispute between Mantra DAO, Inc. and RioDeFi — its infrastructure host — and former RioDeFi employees who allegedly misappropriated funds and business from Mantra.*

Sounds like some employees are gonna be in trouble.
