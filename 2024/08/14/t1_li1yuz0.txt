$Sharbi, the multichain “Queen of Memes,” came to life in January 2023 and reached a $20 million all-time high (ATH) on Ethereum (ETH)

“Sharbi’s Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) team voted to burn five percent (5%) of $Sharbi supply on the ETH chain, over $18,000 in value, which happens today. Over fifty-six percent (56%) of $Sharbi’s ETH supply is already staked. Next, $Sharbi’s Staking dApp was just released on the Ethereum (ETH) chain. With the move, $Sharbi transitions to a new paid-to-hold (P2H) structure that rewards holders in K9 Finance ($KNINE)”
