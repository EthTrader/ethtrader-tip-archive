Honestly good points for and against but the whole idea is about being unequal, about donuts giving tip weight.Â 


To reverse inequality of weighting after 6 years would be the single most dramatic shift in approach since it started and a 180 on the experiment in this type of governance and change it into another different style.


Even though I see the merits, I just think that level of fundamental change is a very very low % chance of happening and, as with everything, high risk means don't put much time, money or effort in lest you accept that it might be another giant waste of mental energy.
