Upvoting everyone is wrong obviously (should be about rewarding quality posts not blanket upvoting), but by voting rings they mean a group of users colluding to upvote each other, or in the past they would upvote each other then downvote everyone else so that some posts mysteriously unaffected by the downvotes while others were fine.Â 


Simply upvoting everyone is not the same thing and it does or does not hint at your involvment, potential or otherwise, in any upvote rings.
