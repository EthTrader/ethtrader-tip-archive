Robbing is kind of you lmao. Orbiter and Owlto never bothered about launching quests and campaigns when they were pretty much the only options we had for some routes. Now that all bridges are becoming unexpensive you can't even access these two dApps without being bombarded with banners of a thousand ongoing campaigns, everything for the farming to continue lol
