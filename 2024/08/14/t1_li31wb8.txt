>AI agents are coming into the world. An AI agent is like you going to Fiverr and hiring somebody to build your website and hiring someone to do your marketing strategy and all of those kind of things. Somebody goes off, does it, comes back, brings it. Well, AI is going agentic, and we’re going to start to see these kind of tools coming into our existence…

In other words, AI is gonna take people's jobs.
