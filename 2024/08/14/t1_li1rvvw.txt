Tldr:

The upgrade will allow users to create new token trading markets without needing governance approval under the permissionless listing feature.
To list new markets, users must deposit a governance-determined amount of USDC into a new “master liquidity pool” called MegaVault.

Pay certain amount and create any token you need!
