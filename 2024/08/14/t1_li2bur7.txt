>I see people saying they missed the boat on Ethereum.

That's what they said when ETH was $30. They said the same thing when ETH was $100. They repeated it at ETH $500, and $1000, and $2000. Maybe they're right this time. But looking at how wrong they've been in the past, it's probably safe to assume that they're wrong even this time around.
