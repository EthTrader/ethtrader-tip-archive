There's nothing I'll say that'll be new to you. I can't feel your pain but I'm damn sure you'll be really down currently. Please take time out and recover. Time heals man. Shitty things happen in this world but remember you have lots of people who's looking up to you as an inspiration. Please don't give up man and everything is gonna be okay with time. Just remembered you're not alone here.
