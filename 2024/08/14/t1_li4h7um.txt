I turned my back to layer 3 since I sadly didn't qualify because I had like 150 cubes but needed 1 more for the last infinity cube which was a criteria.... The day before I thought I might do it but it was the sandbox stuff and I was so exhausted and thought it'd be a bonus anyways. Well rekt. !tip 1
