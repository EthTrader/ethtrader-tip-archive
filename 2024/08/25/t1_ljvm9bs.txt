I am a bit skeptical but if BTC hits a new ATH then so will ethereum. There's many new and unknown projects that will aid in altcoin season, but it still isn't a completed product. Things will go wild when ethereum has fees less than $0.20 on mainnet. There's plenty of F2E altcoin s I have but I can't exactly move them.

But gains have not been realized from the triple halvening yet, it still just kind of follows Bitcoin. Maybe this halvening will push a supply shock with new projects.
