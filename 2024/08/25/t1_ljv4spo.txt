Isn't life itself an echo chamber?

Just open your eyes, look around you, be realistic, and tell me: without all the good things we create to convince ourselves, even unconsciously, what governments, advertisements, etc. tell us so we don’t stop and keep moving, can you honestly say that the world is a good place to live in?

If your answer is Yes, that means that you didn't open your eyes enough.

If your answer is No, welcome to hell.

TLDR; People need echo chambers to overcome every drama in their lives.
