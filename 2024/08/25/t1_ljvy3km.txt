Nah, I don't think it's done on purpose. The mods are humans, they make mistakes. This is why the topic limiter would help the sub. These nukings should be automated.

>and it's not the first time my modmail get ignored

Are you saying that they are ignoring your modmail and reviewing other users' modmails? ðŸ‘€

>plus, the pay2post fees for those 2 posts is gone at this point, even if they bring them back ðŸ™ƒ


Just let it go mate, shit happens. I've got 5 posts nuked this round. 3 of them were about polymarkets but mods told me that it's not Eth related because the story was mainly about trump Vs Kamala and not polymarket itself.
