>The only thing we can do is hold the good moments to survive and be "happy

I've thought about different things about this life as a whole and asked some older smart people "WHAT IS LIFE" & the only answer they gave me is " TO JUST LIVE YOUR LIFE HAPPILY BY DOING WHAT YOU LOVE DOING" and don't hurt others. Which makes me find more interest in space and astronomers(because looking through space and thinking how little we are as humans makes me smile :).

Life is a depressing sh!th0le until you have a reason to not give up and do exactly what you love doing everyday
