>People need echo chambers to overcome every drama in their lives.

True, this life itself is a hâ‚¬ll on it own. Religious create heaven to give people hopium that there's life after death which no one can prove right(they might be right or wrong, who knows)

Some believe there's nothing like afterlife and some believe when we died, our souls live our bodies to other bodies. We still do not know which one is true or false, if we have to think deep about life, everyone will be depressed asf. 

We all just have to be drunk on something to keep us moving. People posting hopium on ETH just needs not to give up because this bear market itself and the ETF etc can make people go numb
