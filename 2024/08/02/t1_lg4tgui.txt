Seems like a decent idea going forward with a couple of other benefits.

Aside from preventing potential scammers, should anything happen to Reddit, the Discord serve is still there. 

Could also lead to future developments with potentially a Discord Bot for tipping xD

only downside I can think of is the cost/hours needed to spend developing it.

It could also force other users to register for DONUT first, and then join the discord, such as potential banner renters, not that that is necessarily a bad thing.

I'd be saying [YES] unless I someone points out further downside.
