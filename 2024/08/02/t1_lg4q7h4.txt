Memberships used to be around $5-$7 a month. considering seasons will last for 2 months, the price seems right. So it would technically be $5 a month.

Note that this is just the first season, so not all perks will be unlocked yet. The idea is to expand the perks outside the subreddit on a more global scale, that is, to the whole Donut ecosystem.
