That headline was disconcerting! 

*The FBI has just warned that scammers are â€œimpersonating cryptocurrency exchange employees to steal funds".*

Makes sense. Always be vigilant, and always go through proper support systems!

*Call the cryptocurrency exchange's official phone number to verify if there is a problem. Do not use any phone number the caller provides.*
