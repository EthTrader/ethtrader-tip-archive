Thats what I thought at first, Discord is separate from Reddit, however, if Discord is also an extension of the EthTrader community, then it theoretically is a DAO concern?

Depends on what the future constitution stipulates, while moderational interpretations don't strictly need Governance approval, it does seem like a binding rule that requires Governance support. 

But again, would that entirely depend on the wording of the Constitution, if it includes EthTrader on other platforms?
