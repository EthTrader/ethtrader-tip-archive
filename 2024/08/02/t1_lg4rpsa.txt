Hey [I wrote about this](https://new.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bax227/a_man_is_facing_court_after_cryptocom/) half a year ago! I can't believe this is considered theft. If we were the ones to send money to someone by accident, the bank would just say "aaand it's gone".

The same goes for Crypto.com. If they would've mistakenly sent millions to the wrong person, they wouldn't care.

This case is a joke.
