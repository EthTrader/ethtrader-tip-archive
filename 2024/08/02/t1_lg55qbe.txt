Tough one for me. I do like the fact people could join and say things freely without worrying about what they've said (if they don't make it obvious who they are of course)

I do enjoy the occasional troll joining the discord too ngl xD

But overall with the safety concerns I'd have to go with [YES]. Plenty of scammers have been adding us recently and posing as mods so they are clearly in the discord
