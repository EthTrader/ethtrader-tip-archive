Duplicate stories should get removed when Ray has time to go through them.

We are waiting on Multisig approval to fund an Initiative to develop a "Topic Limiter" I believe.

And in the meantime, farmers will complain that we already have too many complicated rules.

Best you can do for now is not tip duplicate stories, and instead report them to  the mods so they can be removed.
