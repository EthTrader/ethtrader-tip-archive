Yeah it is obvious that farming will be the inevitable consequences but I believe it should be mitigated to some capacity in favor of actually high quality content, to be an incentive for making it. 

It's amazing that people could earn money from comments and an amazing idea like donuts could do extraordinarily well as a decentralized way for earning from content creation but it's growth as a project is stagnated as by being just another way to attract the greedy that  create with low quality stuff nobody wants to see. If instead we prompted well made interesting that are meaningful post and comments we could attract more outsiders.
