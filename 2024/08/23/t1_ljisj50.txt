I have this serious disease where I believe that if presented with facts and evidence and logic that people will change their minds. 


At least it's super obvious to everyone, that's something, even if they won't admit it we all know it's just all about money.


If positive sentiment did a thing then all these rcps would be up massively, my problem isn't hopium and copium and blatant farming, it's the inability to integrate feedback - hope is not a strategy and leaving positive comments fools nobody, words don't change the world actions do. 


Not enough people are buying donut for it to go up, and it takes almost no money to do that but most are here to earn free crypto or feeding then getting off on the various dramas, with the hopes of getting rich quickly or grasp at the saddest, tiniest shred of power they'll never have anywhere else in life. That's the absolute truth.
