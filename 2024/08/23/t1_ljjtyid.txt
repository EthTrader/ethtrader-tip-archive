When we talk about the laziest person in this sub.... I'll volunteer as one. To even make proposal is stressful to me and I usually give Kudos to people who does that. If things isn't related to art(which I do) or science and tech(which I find interest in) I'm lazy to the rest. 

Even commenting on the sub sometimes took time which I just decided to be active members for this rounds
