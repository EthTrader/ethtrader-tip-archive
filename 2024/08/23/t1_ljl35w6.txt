In case you're unaware, CBDCs are a government-run digital currency that allows them to monitor and control **every single transaction you make**, no matter how small.

There is a hypothesis that governments will be able to force people to spend their money, by putting an expiration date on it.

CBDCs allow bureaucrats to quickly punish you for spreading “misinformation.” You can be fined, or have these assets frozen.

This is bad, BAD.
