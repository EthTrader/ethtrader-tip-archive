I'll preface this by saying I hold a substantial amount of eth, may as well be an eth maxi at this point, I'm waiting for a bull run and haven't sold a thing and won't be selling a thing.


But..


I am very concerned. All these positive sounding changes and bugger all happens to the prices. If anyone is honest money is why we're here and everyone else knows that acutely. Politics is a clusterfuck and cannot be fixed, Blackrock and others control a lot of crypto, governments are systematically clamping down, cexs are influential in the same way as banks now and are beholden to the same people that ruined the existing financial system, scams have not slowed down and it's very unsafe. 


I'm expecting a bull run but I don't know if it'll actually happen, like are these nefarious charlitans actually going to allow the population to escape their rat race? Really? You've more faith than I if you think that a society set up around the working class' labour and deliberats austerity is gonna let them break free.
