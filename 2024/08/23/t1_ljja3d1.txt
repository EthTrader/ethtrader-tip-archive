I repeated myself a few times there as well and we've spoken about this 10 times now and it doesn't get through. Or worse after being told a paid listing is not possible they move the goalposts to a free listing instead.


The problem is nobody wants to buy any, the hubris to say the market got this one wrong is insane, 90% loss speaks for itself.
