What's the difference? Why would anyone trust someone they haven't met before with their entire savings? It doesn't make any sense at all. If this happened to an underaged person, I'll totally understand, but not to an adult. This has nothing to do with gaining ones trust, this is extreme greed.

So, if I have a close buddy in this sub, I can send them my tokens since they've gained my trust?
