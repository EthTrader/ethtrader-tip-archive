It was wen_eip that said it, I just searched around the sub. Fairly sure kraken dont list for free never mind all the others, seems extremely unlikely that nobody paid for any of the multiple listings and much much more likely that a cex charge listing fees and someone paid, considering we know that all of those cexs definitely charge money and no evidence has been presented of any kind, for or against other than he said she said. I remember looking into it quite deeply when I joined the sub.
