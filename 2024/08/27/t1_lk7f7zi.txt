Duplicate (I check very carefully, but it still happens), unwitting posts about competing coins. And some removed with arguments I don't agree with. It really pisses me off when a post gets read thousands of times and has over 100 comments because I try to reply and waste time and effort.

But the facts are such and I accept them.
