>What do you mean? He's a co-founder of Ethereum.

Yeah I wanted him to do what Charles Hoskinson did. He can leave and create something like another ETH killers for free transactions :)

>They both at one point wanted to make the transactions free, but they later changed their mind.

Wait so you're telling me, ETH can be free transactions but they change their mind and make the gas very high? Are they both drunk😏 that's the reason why I put most of my ETH on WETH (polygon and Arbitrum).

They needs to fix their shit fr this time
