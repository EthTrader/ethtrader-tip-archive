>Yes ,I've seen alot of links about scam presales get tipped, which is insane. People don't even read what's inside the link.

Problem with this is the psychology of reciprocation. I don't tip posts that I'm absolutely confident will be removed, paid shills etc - and the users who post most of them don't tip my content, because i don't tip theirs xD

Guaranteed tip results would look very differently if user names were hidden.
