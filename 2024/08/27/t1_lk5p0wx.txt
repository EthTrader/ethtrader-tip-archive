There's not enough people or activity anymore to justify fragmenting or limiting anything much further. There's a point of no return where these things implode, I deal with it on a daily basis at work. 


There's stereotype dictionary definition personality and group dynamic archetypes at play here that transcend me or you, it's unfortunate but they're human nature so can't be reformed. 


Giving people the idea that they can change things in the sub is like that phrase 'when you're the hammer, everything looks like a nail' because you can change stuff doesn't mean it's good or bad to do so, often it's actually bad or you solve one problem then create one new problem or a worse one that can't be helped.


Ego, greed, drama, bullying, personal power trips, cliques, financial incentives, delusion, politics, echochamberism and many others, all coupled with an extremely volatile industry and peoples hopes and dreams pinned on the idea of financial freedom is a dry powder keg waiting for a spark.


In my opinion, don't rock the boat until all the changes have had some time to settle and assess how their impact uninhibited by a flurry of new rules.


Sorry for the long read, I have absolutely no idea why I do this or feel the need to keep doing this at all when it brings me no good, maybe just oppisitional defiance and an easy unstressful life making me soft.
