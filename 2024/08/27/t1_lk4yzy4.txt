Never buy exchange tokens. Fundamentally they are still shitcoin because they serve no purpose outside of being outside of being just liquidity rewards which already, from a tokenconomics point of view puts on them a high selling pressure. 


The only exception is BNB but that is because Binance has its own Blockchain network so it doesn't count. Still your better off buying Ethereum or meme coins if you like to degen the proper way.
