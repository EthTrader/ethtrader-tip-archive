>Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, has experienced a significant downturn in August 2024, with a 55% drop in the seven-day moving average of daily volume compared to the previous month. Daily transactions also fell to their lowest level in several months, reaching only 1.07 million transactions last Sunday.
