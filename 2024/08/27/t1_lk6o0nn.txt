It wouldn't be possible anyway, as we can't alter Reddit's platform; but, as someone who has actively busted multiple alt-accounts rings with both account behavior patterns and blockchain evidence, plus proposed rules which have hindered farming efforts, I know I've got my share of haters too. 

It is what it is.
