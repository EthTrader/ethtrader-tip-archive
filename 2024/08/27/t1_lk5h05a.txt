None of them were particularly good to me. 

Maybe the post cooldown. But I still think one should be able to post when they want to, based on their schedule.

I think the fact that mornings are busy is just a reflection of the majority of bronuts are in EU time zones and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that.

But at the same time, I think that poll could be good. Idk.

Wbu?
