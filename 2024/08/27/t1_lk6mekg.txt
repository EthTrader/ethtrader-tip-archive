>The Ministry of Digital Economy, Science and Technology in Edo State, Nigeria, has partnered with INTMAX, a leader in Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, to drive blockchain innovation

With what I understand, EDO is just a state in Nigeria which is in the eastern country and the vast majority of crypto people are in the western part because Lagos is where has the highest state population.

Never heard of INTMAX btw but I know it's a nice adoption and it's a good things for Nigerians who are crypto friendly :)
