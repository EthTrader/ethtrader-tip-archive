My personal opinion is a question always remains a question. The flair wouldn't have been necessary if some users didn't start using the flair as a loop hole.  
That is why the mods needs to have some sort of discretion. Maybe in your case the question is genuine and can drive reasonable discussion and shouldn't be flaired question. Its never going to be black and white.
