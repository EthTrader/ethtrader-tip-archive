Honestly I donâ€™t even expect alts to pump anytime soon, because even ETH has not been performing well against BTC.

Following the historical pattern of:

1. Big BTC pump and increase in BTC dominance

2. Big ETH pump

3. Big pump in all ALTS

I would say we are still a long way away from an ALTS pump
