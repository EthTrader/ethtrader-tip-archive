I don’t think they can be exactly comparable. At least directly. Donut and moons have different tokenomics.

MOON is capped, deflationary, decentralized, and has no smart contract ownership.

DONUT is the opposite of all the characteristics mentioned above… ish. Not saying it’s bad, or that it’s worse. Just different. It’s got its own ecosystem.

Even though Moons have better tokenomics, they are not as scalable as Donut. And due to the current situation, it probably never will be. DONUT has an active team behind it, constantly developing and improving the ecosystem.

But because MOON has better tokenomics, the market favors the token more, which is reflected on the price.

I think Moons are the Bitcoin of reddit, while Donut is Ether.
