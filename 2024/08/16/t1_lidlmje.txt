Its not a crypto unfriendly bank issue. Its not that Im doing shady or illegal stuff.

Its plain banker stupidity and the fact that Banks are obsolete if you ask me. They dont have or accept cash. And since everything is digital and they suck at it, why not go for some services that are faster, cheaper, more Secure and more efficient?

Ethereum does this Way better
