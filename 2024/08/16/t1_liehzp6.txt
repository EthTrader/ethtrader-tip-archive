Hamster kombat, users to be considered lucky if they get even $20 

Considering the amount of users in millions and a totally free game 

The only possibility I thought of is hamster kombat gaining revenues from tasks given to users like watching YouTube videos which will be generating them good chuck of money, but still I donâ€™t believe till I see it
