It kinda a risk, there's possibility of it rises but it depends on how early you are on the project. If you're very early, you're good but if not, you might be the developers exit liquidity.

I usually search for newly launched coins but some do take time to rise, like shiba inu for example took months before it pump. Wishing you the best buddy
