Probably a good call!

I went with the gamble of staking 100% of my allocation under the idea that in in August next year, we'll be in the midst of a bull run and everything will have some hype. If so, buy pressure will massively overwhelm any supply unlocks, which I don't think L3 have for a while anyway.

Either way, it's pretty much free money to begin with!
