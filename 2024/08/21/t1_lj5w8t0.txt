that kind of tipping is spontaneous over there and it doesn't count as a vote to earn donut token.

this sub has always been kind of dead, not just after the low IQ spam nuking.

It has been around forever, and donuts too, performing like shit, and people should start thinking that maybe the problem is not only us farmers, but also the way the sub is managed 

ps: many non spammers bronuts have left lately, so we shouldn't keep saying that the sub nuked the spammers and the alt accounts only, because the truth is that we scared / bored away many deserving Bronuts like we are doing for newcomers 

that's my opinion, of course, and I respect yours 😁
