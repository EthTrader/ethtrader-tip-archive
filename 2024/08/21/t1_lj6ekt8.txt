Imagine being whatever coin maxi and missing out on ETH rocket for just being blind. I love how all the companies are starting to push hard to make their customers buy their ETH ETFs.

Not a fan of banks but my life is short so money is my priority to reach my goals while supporting good things as decentralization with the little power I have.
