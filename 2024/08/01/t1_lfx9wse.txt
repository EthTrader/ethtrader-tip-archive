Considering that ETH is above $3000 right now and has been holding above it for months I think price action hasn't been bad at all. ETH failed to break last bulls ATH but BTC broke theirs. Now that ETFs are listed hype will probably die down for a while and we might enter a bear market. Remember that BTC leads the market and ETH closely follows.
