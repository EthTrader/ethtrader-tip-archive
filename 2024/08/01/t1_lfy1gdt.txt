>It's a shame because these underappreciated posts often contain the best contentâ€”deep insights, critical analyses, and detailed technical info that can genuinely enhance our understanding. It feels like we're losing the diversity and quality of discussions that once made this sub great.

And people wonder why the sub isn't growing, when an unregistered user such as yourself can observe this. 

Unfortunately the tipping culture largely results in reciprocal tipping, you tip me, I tip you, now lets share rewards.

A lot of low quality content gets tipped, while often more informative helpful comments get ignored because of who wrote a comment, rather than what was written.

low quality links get tipped more by people who don't even read them than quality submissions for the same reason.
