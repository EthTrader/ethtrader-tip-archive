If you haven’t write the song here’s the lyrics: 

In the world of bits and bytes, there’s a new dawn rising,  
A revolution’s brewing, no more compromise in.  
From the blockchains to the tokens, it’s a whole new scene,  
Crypto’s got the magic, it’s a digital dream.


Crypto is awesome, it’s the future calling,  
Breaking down the barriers, no more walls are falling.  
From the Bitcoin to the Ether, watch the markets gleam,  
Crypto’s got the power, living out the dream.


Decentralized and fearless, we’re paving new ways,  
Smart contracts and the miners, lighting up the days.  
In the realm of crypto, we’re the pioneers,  
Changing how we trade, bringing all the cheers.


Crypto is awesome, it’s the future calling,  
Breaking down the barriers, no more walls are falling.  
From the Bitcoin to the Ether, watch the markets gleam,  
Crypto’s got the power, living out the dream.


No more waiting on approvals, no more lines to stand,  
With the rise of crypto, we’re taking our stand.  
From the wallets to the exchanges, it’s an open road,  
Crypto’s lighting up the world, watch the story unfold.


Crypto is awesome, it’s the future calling,  
Breaking down the barriers, no more walls are falling.  
From the Bitcoin to the Ether, watch the markets gleam,  
Crypto’s got the power, living out the dream.


So let’s ride this wave together, let’s take on the scene,  
In the world of crypto, we’re chasing the dream.  
With each block and each ledger, our future’s unseen,  
Crypto is awesome, it’s the ultimate dream.
