I checked the charts, they’re up and down,  
Like a yo-yo dancer in a crypto town!  
I thought I’d invest, be a rich guy,  
Now I’m just here, asking “Why, oh why?”

(Chorus)  
Crypto is awesome, or so they claim,  
But my wallet’s playing a sad, sad game!  
I’m chasing the trends, but they’re running fast,  
Just like my dreams of a fortune that won’t last!

LMAO
