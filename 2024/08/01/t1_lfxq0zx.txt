Before we had downvoter who were downvoting everything to shit trying to cheat the game.

The tipping system is shit how it is set up, the ballance between donut and contrib points of the reciever sould be counted if someone get full a upvote(bit the same system as r/cc used to have)

But again, its better now with the T2V because not everything gets downvoted to shit by cheaters.
