[NO] people who have a full 1 weight should just not care, abs the others as well. If you interact you will get there. It took a year for me and i did not mind nor do i noticed any mistreatment.
Also i currently have multiple data analysis on t2v and i dont see and major cheating going on.

If you want i will also have a look next week if users with not a full weight really struggle more and let you know.
