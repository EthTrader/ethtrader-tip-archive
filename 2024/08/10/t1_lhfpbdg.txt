Just like everything that’s new in the crypto space, it gets a lot of hype. And hype is what sells the most. That’s what happened with NFTs.

I don’t really think they add any value to the space, other than expectations of flipping for a superior price. But I guess that’s the case with most tokens.

The good thing about NFTs is that they contribute to deflation. If there’s a lot of volume in the NFT market, network’s busy and gas goes up. As a consequence, it helps burn some of the supply.
