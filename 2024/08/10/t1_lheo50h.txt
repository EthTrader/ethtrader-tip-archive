Definitely agree you can see people interact less with people with less donuts and unregistered users

I don't think it's because of the tipping situation though. It's because we've had so many alts most people are worried it's an alt xD

There are plenty of accounts now that behave exactly the same as a certain user who got banned and many think those accounts belong to that user

It's a complicated situation
