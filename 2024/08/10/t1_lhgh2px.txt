The OGs of the sub are mostly registered.... If you look at the sub post and comments some years ago, you'll find that most old users here are registered. They might just not be active anymore due to because, they're facing IRL stuff or are tired with the bear.

Most aggressive unregistered users who are here might not just be interested in donut and are angry how the sub just turns into donut farming. But thank the new rules is changing everything btw and I'm kinda sure that the OGs will be back when bullrun started
