Pepe has a good cash in opportunity now. I think I did a trade some time ago where I bought at this exact level, and then sold after it removed a zero. It was a solid swing trade.

Not saying it’ll happen again, but there’s an opportunity here.

I’d do it again, but I don’t have liquidity available.

Not financial advice.
