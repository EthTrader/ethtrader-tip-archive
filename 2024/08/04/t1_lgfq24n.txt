Nah there's loads of way better reasons than no volume, no money to pay a cex listing fee, no availablility of reputable exchange for free listings, seems people are against it as an idea.


Also GONE got a free listing and the price still never went up which is the secret reason anyone wants a cex - personal profit. Earning them for 0.00 and then dumping after the listing.
