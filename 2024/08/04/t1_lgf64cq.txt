Not really. No trading volume is boring. And prices going down, while, doesn't change price asset ratio's, just means things are worth less. It's not bad per say, but it's not good either. But, even without trading volume, DONUT will increase again as ETH does.

The fun part is to trade DONUT in and out while ETH is moving, which can result in profits.
