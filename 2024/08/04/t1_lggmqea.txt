That's a really valid point! Over-diversifying is not ideal, and tbh it's quite exhausting.

However, the main point of my post is about sticking to just one single project, when the decision is driven by ego rather than a financial strat.

I think there should be balance. Information, education, strategy. Those are the most important factors in the game. A few well chosen projects can be more beneficial than putting all your eggs in one basket.
