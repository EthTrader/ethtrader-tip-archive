Nerve wracking! I keep a lot of eth on mexc after I stopped using coinbase. It does not feel good to have a 5 fig sum on a cex but I don't trust ledger anymore either. The taxman wants so much of it anyway because I have a relatively high paying job ðŸ˜… difficult to know what to do but have to take it into self custody soon
