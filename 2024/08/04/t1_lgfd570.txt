Well buying is your choice. I've myself bought 200k donuts at an average price of 0.015. I'm not buying now because I've invested too much on such small cap coin. But I'm sure donut will go like rocket or the opposite. I want either huge gains or nothing.

And about the traded history you can search your wallet address on ARBscan or gnosisscan wherever you had donuts previously
