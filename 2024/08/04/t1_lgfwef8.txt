It's very bad yes. The market speaks for itself though, there are no accidents, no maybes, no asterisks next to the 80% loss, the numbers are what they are because nobody wants to buy any. People buy good projects all the time, not an opinion but all numbers and stats soÂ it's not possible to have a comeback.
