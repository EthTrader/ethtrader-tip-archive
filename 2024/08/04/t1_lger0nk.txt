The problem comes when people start making dreams out of crypto (or even stocks). No, itâ€™s not happening. Crypto should always be a side hustle, with more focus on your actual career. Not everyone can be a successful trader or investor. For me, crypto is always going to be more of a passion or hobby rather than something I depend on for survival. I wouldn't fucking care if it goes to zero.
