There's nothing much I can say to ease your pain that people haven't told you yet.

 All I just want to let you know is, no matter what happens in life, we'll still keep on pushing. It maybe hard to believe right now but the way you're currently feeling will change with time. Stay strong man and things gonna get better soon
