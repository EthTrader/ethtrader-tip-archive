>The beta version of 'Ragnarok: Monster World,' a blockchain-based tower defense game, has launched on the Ethereum sidechain gaming network, Ronin. This marks the first venture into blockchain gaming for the South Korean franchise of Ragnarok Online, which has been popular since its 2002 launch.

I hope this one is a success other than those Blockchain games in the past
