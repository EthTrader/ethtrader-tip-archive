I tell you these things because they increase security a lot and you decide. Don't use a password manager. No one is sure! Create the passwords yourself and store them in at least three different physical locations. Get a good paid antivirus program that can protect you in financial transactions. Like Kaspersky, which flags everything you touch. Or outright blocks something questionable, even if you trust it. A cold wallet is mandatory for such amounts. Clean up all temporary files after each session. There are more things I do because security in crypto is everything. I still can't believe what happened to you, but you have to realize that you made a series of big mistakes. Fix them and move on. Life is ahead of you.
