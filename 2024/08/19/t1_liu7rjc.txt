So sorry for your loss, brother. I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to cope with losing something you had been working and stacking for so long, only to see it disappear in seconds.  
It seems like the scammer has been working on this for a long time now and had most of the information he needed before making the move. That trojan was just the final nail in coffin.

Also, i would never depend on Windows Defender to keep my PC secure. New malwares can bypass it if it have new type of sigrantures. I have been stuck with Norton as long as i remember and never had a problem.

Try to keep your mind busy and start stacking up again.  
I hope your funds gets recovered soon.
