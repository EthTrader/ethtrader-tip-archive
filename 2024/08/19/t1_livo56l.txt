We've written privately already in a brief manner, and I think there isn't much to add that hasn't been said already. I know that you are resilient and will get through this. Feel free to reach out whenever you want & as someone with a history of mental health issues I'd advice to really take things easily during this period. We humans are sadly way more emotional than rational at times and during periods of crisis we often tend to dig in and fall into unhealthy habits. Hold a good routine, go for a run, take your therapy and a brighter future is ahead. You're ingenious and will be back at the ~24k sooner than you think. 

¡Te saldrás de esta y mucho ánimo! Un gran abrazo.
