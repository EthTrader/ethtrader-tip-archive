>My bet is that the hacker knows me

Exactly this. Ordinary person can't just go around and hack a wallet and then decided to withdraw a coin that's in arbitrum Nova or gnosis/arbitrum one without knowing about it. These person knows you and might have been targeting you for long. 

It's weird how people are this cruel irl. Please don't give up man, and with time, things gonna be good. Time heals buddy
