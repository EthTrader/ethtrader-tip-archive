Thank you for sharing you experience and advice, so we can all learn from it.

Losing that kinda money would drive me insane as well, even though its "only money" its also the time/effort/dream etc. You put in it that just got wiped away.

I hope you can make it back fast.

But most of all,

I hope you recover mentally fast and that the ptsd wont be a life long thing 🙏
