So the leaderboard is showing whoever gave the most individual tips as number 1 but it doesn't mean they've given the most Donuts or even close to it

My suggestion was a separate table with the leaderboard based on total Donuts tipped 

For example I'm 17th but I've probably tipped more total Donuts than anyone other than Aminok

!tip 1
