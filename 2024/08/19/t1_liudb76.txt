A hell of a week to be honest. Recovering all the accounts, increasing my security, etc. is a hell of a work.

Pain will go, I assure you. I am trying to make that pain be less when I remember in a proper way now.

Currently I am setting a PC just for crypto. I will have my own ATM at home xD Personal computer for whatever shit.
