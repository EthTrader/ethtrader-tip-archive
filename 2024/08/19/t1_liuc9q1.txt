Holy shit, this read gave me goosebumbs on my entire body. I could literally feel the pain while reading the entire story...

I'm feeling so sorry - but i'm still thinking how that hacker was able to get into your Wallets without any passwords?

Could it be that he used some kind of backdoor from Metamask or something like that? I mean how was he able to do transactions on your Hot Wallets without any password? It might be good to figure that out, so that one could avoid those Wallets at any way.

I'm sure you will recover from this, but it will ofcourse take some time. If you need someone to talk, just hit me up on Discord or wherever..

And of course every penny counts. Take these Donuts. Its not much, but it comes from heart.
