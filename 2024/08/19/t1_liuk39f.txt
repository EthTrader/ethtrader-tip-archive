Thanks a lot DBR! One of the things I realized during this week is that I enjoy Reddit and even thought I have lost 3 years of time and effort and maybe a rocket. Life is like this and it will hurt for some time but life is about losing more than winning so we must move forward.

Not sure how active I will be but I am 100% sure that I will be around. Funny thing is that drawing Reddit avatars really helped me to hold during this week. Good way to get your feelings out of your chest.
