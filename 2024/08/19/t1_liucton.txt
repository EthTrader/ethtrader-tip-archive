My bet is that the hacker knows me. I also believe he talks German because of one Google email I got that suddenly switched to German (weird).

Anyway, I have made complaints with all the proof and other interesting information to 2 different police departments in Spain/Europe, some scam alert sites and also to the FBI.

I dont expect recovering them but well, just in case better to fill all the complaints possible.

Time heals but I will need to work on some stuff with my psychologist because I am really developing a PTSD that I dont want to have.
