Take all the time you need to heal Kirt

That was one sick psycho to purchase a special telegram membership, stalk you to hack, and then convince Google that he was you!

Correct me if I'm wrong anyone, but this does not seem to be an ordinary hack from scam centres and everything? I doubt such people would know about Reddit coins and to stalk a user all the way to telegram?

Seems like a sophisticated hacker who is also a smart individual. Anyway, glad that you are feeling a bit better, take all the time you need - as painful as it is over time you can recover the 25k from the Fiatnam job and its not the end of the world
