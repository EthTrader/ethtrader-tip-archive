The reason why they treated binance that way is because they needed money and was trying to gain info on Nigerians who are trading on binance which won't be professional if binance drop those info. Now that they don't see the option to gain from binance and it Nigeria based users, they're trying to implement tax on it users even after banning so many CEX in the country. I guess the tax will come from their local CEX
