Something that everybody invested in ETH should read.

My problem with this 21kshares, Kraken, etc. "articles" explaining crypto stuff is that they most of the times use AI to create them. This one screams 100% AI when checking in AI detectors and I have found the same behavior on Kraken "articles" in the past.

I wouldn't have a problem if those articles were validated by experts before they release them but they are not that transparent.

I mean, AI is a great tool in a good hands but if you put someone with the knowledge about a topic to create articles about that topic, well, AI can lie a lot xD

Anyway, great content. Looks solid!
