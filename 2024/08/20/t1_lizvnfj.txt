If this implementation helps users to submit less duplicates, thats great... if not, that's on them, they know the rules, and have had ample opportunity to adjust to them and learn to have some awareness of what's already submitted on the sub.

IMO one issue is removal of posts only takes place once in 24-48 hours, which is why some duplicates remain in the feed for so long - but hopefully this helps reduce that.
