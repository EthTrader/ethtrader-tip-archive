Yeah much like the good things happening in these subreddits, the price does not go up. Donuts are 90% down from the 6c high, even though loads appears to be happening, none of it is convincing anyone to buy or growing the member numbers, marketing is non existant and nobody bought the banner in what years, cant even remember seeing anyone ever rent it?


Halving, etfs, adoption, blackrock and others controlling stuff and nothing, just crabbing for ages.


At this rate it'll be a flop and people will just call it a supercycle and pretend they knew it was coming all along.


Still hoping to make lifechanging money but if all these changes don't do anything what's the use, may as well not hold anything because it's all just loss unless you're connected or influential.
