Less post removals due to duplicates - people are in a rush to post stories they come across. If people are less rushed due to cool-down, they could do more due-diligence and not post a duplicate story... not only will this cause less work for the mods, it should also result in less nuked posts and also a cleaner news feed.

A secondary benefit will also potentially allow other users to share stories. Some users only make a few posts per round, and most of them get deleted because they were beaten to the punch. 

And finally, it should make the sub more consistent with staggered submissions, rather than a "peak hour" where 30 posts are submitted in a 2 hour time-frame, and then 3 posts submitted in another 2 hour timeframe.
