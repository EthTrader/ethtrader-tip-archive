A whole bunch of [YES] votes from me for post cooldown, text post requirements, link multiplier and question multiplier.

Given there is a proposal to reduce rewards for links, I will also vote [YES] to allowing AI generated news back. I would also suggest we keep tabs on some which are blatantly 100% AI generated and simply blacklist those sources.

Definitely voting [NO] to deleting the "Weight system" and "Moderator Discretion" - supporting either of those proposals will be taking steps backwards from what we have been moving forwards with over course of the year.
