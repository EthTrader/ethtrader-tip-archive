ARB is my favourite for sure, but I quite like ZKSync as well.

And definitely, ARB will be one of the biggest and more popular networks and from there perhaps one day we expand onto other Arbitrum specific dex's too.

Not to mention MOON is also on Arbitrum as well now, keeping the main RCP's on the same network.
