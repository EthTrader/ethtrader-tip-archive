I legit think we should actually reduce some of the "post" rewards - but perhaps throw them into the treasury for now; and eventually allocate some to cryptotrader down the track if that's a thing.

Just a shame there are so few actual traders around using DONUT to increase their ETH holdings.

Thanks for the pow - a shame posts about trading get so little attention on this sub xD
