Under that maths, yes, but in reality, no, because Ray is using an old template still... 

My proposal which is in place currently stipulates;

*I propose the Voter bonus is increased to 10% karma/vote score & 2.5% per additional poll in which vote is cast.*

*Vote in 2 polls, receive a 12.5% bonus, Vote in 3, 15% etc.*

so, 7 proposals is actually going to provide a +25% bonus to your vote scores.
