That's why staking in the last 2 years has been cool, no way in hell would I start staking things towards the end of the year.

My last endeavor was staking $L3 for 12 months in July this year, locking it to secure a bonus, and being an early staker to secure another... boasting 40% APY

But, I'm also really gunning on the fact, when it unlocks, July next year, we will be in the midst of a bull run, and it will be a great time to sell, and cash in on rewards.
