>With lower fees it will help to increase adoption by attracting more users and projects to the Ethereum ecosystem 

Exactly this

>Lower gas fees will help in mass adoption and I personally donâ€™t think extremely low Gas fees to remain for that long before it starts spiking again, so if you have any transactions to do avail the opportunity as we might not see this extremely low lucrative Gas fees soon

But I still don't see any news yet about ETH inflows/gas fees for whales as buying opportunities. I guess the lower gas fees news isn't mainstream yet to lots cryptobros as not many of em might even know what GWEI means
