Dont think anyone is keeping statistics on the daily comment count, its about 1k a day and half of them are bot comments. 


Plus you can always do that thing where you deliberately select a timeframe that proves a point, like losing half the active members 2 rounds ago obviously caused a massive dip in activity. But if you calculate it in the last few weeks instead it looks stable. 


The psychology of it is baffling, you can basically echo chamber yourself into believing almost anything.
