>BlackRock definitely buying and they might be buying with unknown addresses  
Being a registered asset manager its unlikely they'll do that.

>Even Grayscale outflows if you noticed just decreasing, and it might be a set up from the beginning with that outflows  
Same thing happened with GBTC, when market goes down, offloading cools down.

>Think about it, why to buy Grayscale ETF and pay x10 on fees? Not logical   
HNIs and Institutions don't want to go through hassle of creating an account, then onramp fiat for buying assets on exchanges. ETF makes it easier for them and they hardly care about the fees.
