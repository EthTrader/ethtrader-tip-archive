It all started with japan and FUD hit retail traders who sold aggressively 

The good thing is ETH got rid of all these paper handed, sooner or later they would have sold and created another dip 

On the other side institutions are scooping ETH slowly and steady and all the paper handed will jump in again as FOMO hits them 

Itâ€™s just a month or two before ETH is back on track and ready for the Bullrun and might be sooner
