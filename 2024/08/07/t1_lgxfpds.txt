One of the main reasons was Yen carry trade going berserk. Japan had near 0% interest rate in last 3 decades which was usually used by traders to take loan and trade it for currencies and bonds with high yields, then after a while trade back those to yen again to pay the loan and make some profits as well. 

But i guess, them raising the rate just by 0.25% wasn't the only factor. It was still way lower than the yields traders were getting.
