Depends on your position and where the market is heading.

I spent 2022 DCAing, and I spent 2023 lump summing into the dips.

Both of these tactics for those respective years were the best approach - I accumulated consistently when the market was in a crabbish/downtrend, and I only accumulated the local low ranged in 2023 when the market was in a very obvious uptrend.
