>India’s finance ministry began taking a stricter stance on cryptocurrency exchanges last year. It issued legal notices to several major foreign crypto platforms. These included Binance, Kucoin, and Huobi. The notices claimed these platforms were operating illegally in India by failing to comply with anti-money laundering regulations

>Binance was exploring a return to the Indian market in April. As part of the deal, India’s financial intelligence unit hit the exchange with a $2.25m fine for violating anti-money laundering regulations. This is the largest penalty ever levied on a cryptocurrency company in India for such offenses.

This what happens when your country has a big impact in the crypto industry or any industry (it happens withe FREEFIRE and PUBG, that makes PUBG go create a special indian game called BGMI just for Indian only). 

Nigeria do the same bcos they have one of the top crypto investors as well. So the NGN govt takes it all to foreign CEX too.
