Correct, re-posting shitty memes versus atleast creating new ones is different. But can't really moderate that either xD

It's possible to implement the system, but will take time, and we have like 2 devs within the mod-team. r/cc mod team has atleast 17 users, and several devs. So even things that are missed, are easily picked up by the 17 mods manually.

They also have other systems in place to remove text posts under XX characters, and image only posts, which helps their quality control efforts too
