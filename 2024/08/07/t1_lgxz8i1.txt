>Will DEXes ever be good enough to become actual competitors to centralized exchanges?

I don't think so as both has it pros and cons. CEX in one hands select which coins to be listed on their platforms while DEX only support any chains they feels like it's good to be listed.

Dex is good if you're into much risk and getting many coins as much as you can. When I was new to crypto, I once connected my wallet to pancake to buy polkadot but weeks later, my wallet was drained.

DEX supposed to have some educational advice while connecting your wallet just like what some CEX are doing. And the problem with most DEX is, so many newbies falls for so many scammers using fake DEX sites. So in my opinion, I don't think DEX will ever become actual competitors to CEX because when it comes to security, CEX is the best and people prefer more secure wallet than the ones that might get hacked anyways.
