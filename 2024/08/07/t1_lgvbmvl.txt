I would suggest 0.5

But I would also suggest a proposal that addresses the "self story questions" being labelled "discussion" users are asking basic questions like "what alt coins are you buying? I'm doing this" - and that really should fall under self story as it is not the discussion of ideas or insights

I'm all for the engagement, but to have those question posts flaired as discussion as if it were a post going into detail about politics or analysis needs addressing too
