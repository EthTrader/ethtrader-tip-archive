Even tho I hate all those politics, I think we might see a new big bull rally if Trump is elected. Even him firing Gary Gensler is a positive news for crypto. 

He also promised that the US will become the crypto capital of the world.

I know politicians lie but I still think it'll be a positive impact if Trump elected.
