Dapper I have seen many people, including me with the same mindset, hoping for more dip and when it hits you hope and wait for more and suddenly it’s gone 

Recent dip ETH went down almost a $1k yet people didn’t grab the opportunity 

The same way it dipped a $1000 can also jump another $1000

In crypto the timing is the most important factor
