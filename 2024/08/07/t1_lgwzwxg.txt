Good analysis. So donut trading volume wasn't even up to the current moon trading volume and it was at it new ATH. 

Why are the websites prediction now saying if donut have current moon volume, which is at $13.80M it gonna be at the price of $0.06. Seems those web aren't correct and just spreading false hopium
