Remove P2P and let low quality sink. but as you said "comradery" people will still tip whatever is there, especially if their favorite user has posted it, regardless of the content.

This will add extra burden on the mods trying to remove off-topic content and duplicates, this will dilute the level of quality we have been trying to improve on. 

If there was no pay2post, user can simply post a low quality meme and hope it just gets even 1 or 2 tips and they'll gain reward. Many users will post 3 times a day every day, just because they can, without any potential penalty.

Many already do, but it will absolutely worsen.
