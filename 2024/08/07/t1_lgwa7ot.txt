[NO]

Because i think we may start seeing cheap and low effort text posts and TAs which will be even worse than the link posts. We already have a few of those every now and then with no thought or efforts put behind it.

Instead i would suggest to limit it to 2 posts per day so that feed is not cluttered with irrelevant link posts.
