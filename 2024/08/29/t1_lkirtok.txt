Genuine Q - when they say anything do you actually believe it? After decades of nothing but lies and an objectively worsening society my trust in politics evaporated, personally!Â 


I'd love for them to be saying it because they'll actually change things, but you know.. all the lying and cheating and all that, makes it so difficult
