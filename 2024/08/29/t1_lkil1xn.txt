No, I think let the people Dumpa everything now while its low

Don't push anything until a bull run

Think about it: You do everything good now, encourage people to hold and what's the best result? 1 cent

In a full blown bull run, alts do 5-10x and shitcoins do 100x. Without doing anything Donuts is already at 3 cent and underperforming shitcoins, and when you push out all the good stuff? 

10 cent becomes reality and all those selling now at 0.005 eventually will cry. I say let the sellers and non believers sell while its still low!
