This is not shade thrown, must stress that because the desire to assume is so overwhelming apparently - but Donut and Cone are my degen coins.


Not that they are that shady or degenerate but specifically in terms of a moonshot 'hold and hope' situation, where I've no vested interest and absolutely no money spent on any of them.



Again, not a criticism or an insult, but tiny marketcap coins with low volume, low awareness and very few holders. 


If one of these subs does well and they go up, I'm ready to reap your rewards! :) let's go bull run.
