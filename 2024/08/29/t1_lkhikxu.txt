>The dollar stabilized on Thursday, holding onto its gains from the previous session as traders anticipated the release of the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure.

The dollar's recent movements have been influenced by expectations of U.S. rate cuts, with markets fully pricing in a 25-basis-point reduction next month.
