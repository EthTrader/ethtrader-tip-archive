You sure thats how it works at the moment for 30 minite rule? I'm pretty sure the 30 minute rule isn't implemented unless done manually 

If its 3 within 24 hours whst you said will happen but I post within 30 mins as Matt told me if the bot says your eligible to post you can post. Havent had one removed when I've done them within 30 mins of each other
