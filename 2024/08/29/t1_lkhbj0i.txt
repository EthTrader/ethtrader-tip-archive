Decentraland (MANA)? You must be kidding me. Mana has been dead since 2021. They heard of rate cuts and the possibility of a bullrun, so they surfaced again.
If you plan to be exit liquidity for their bagholders, invest in Mana.
The comparison should be between the likes of Aave, UNI, Chainlink etc.
