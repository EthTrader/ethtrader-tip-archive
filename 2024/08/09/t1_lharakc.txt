it can't be only Reddit ruggiting, 6k donut holders (maybe half unique users) it too low as a number considering how long this sub and donuts have been around.

coneheads and all the other RCC subs have waaay better ratios members/holders and it's time we start wondering why that happens and how that can be improved 

that's what I think
