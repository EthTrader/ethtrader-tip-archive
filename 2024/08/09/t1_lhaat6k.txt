Well a really good thing for Donuts is that now they follow the price of Eth on dexs, so if Eth makes it to 10k in this bull run then that would put Donut at around 2 cents, just less than a 4x from now. In terms of risk, Donut could go up more than Eth with tiny amounts of buys, but the opposite can happen too and big sells can plummet the price as this week with another 30% loss. The gamble is fairly balanced and the advice is too - it's high reward but high risk. Not financial advice.
