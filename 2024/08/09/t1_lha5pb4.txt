I hear you. At least it's quiet and nobody bothers you when you get ignored but sometimes it's like shouting into the void or something, nobody reacts or hears you lol. I like it this way though, peaceful and feel free to tell the truth.

I also don't mind you selling them, people should be free to sell without stigma.
