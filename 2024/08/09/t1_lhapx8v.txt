They are bots. Same case with r/CC

Reddit is inflating over 90%, or close to 99% of their numbers with bots in the case of ethtrader and cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency sub has 6 million members, and something like 1k people qualifying for distribution in an entire month - aka **5.99 million of those users did not make any comments in an entire month**. There is zero chance you can look at those figures and think it is anything but organic, reddit is up to shady business!
