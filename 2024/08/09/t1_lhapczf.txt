No, the answer to this is obvious as hell man

99% of 'subscribers' Reddit subreddits are bot numbers

Even the 5,889 Donut holders is inflated. 

Just look at the number of users qualifying for monthly distribution last month - **200 users qualified for any donuts in an entire month**

Want to know how many % out of 2 million that is? That's **1 in 10,000, or 0.01%.** Which means to say, **99.99% of the 'subs users' did not make any comments last month**!
