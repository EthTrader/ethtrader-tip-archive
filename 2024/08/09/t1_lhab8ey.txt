Shillfluencers incorrectly believed donut and moons were adjacent exposures to the Reddit IPO, shitcoin traders bought then immediately sold once they realized they were totally wrong and reddit actually abandoned rcps apparently. I'm regurgitating this as I only recently learned myself, definitely fact check me before believing, but there were tweets you can find, then all the wallet addresses that bought can be found as well, all bought and all dumped when they realized.
