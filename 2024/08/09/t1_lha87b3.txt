Ahh alright, I didn't know it worked on trading volume.. yeah :( that's why it's low then. 

I was thinking about my own trading lately. High trade volume can be good. It can also be high because it's all sells, which is bad.. and also if those traders make profits then they almost certainly plan to use the profits for themselves at some point, which is also bad. At least at current there are only 4 or 5 wallets removing value from the pools, where encouraging trading would be encouraging people to take money out of the liquidity for everyone else haha!

Maybe that's why no trading incentives happen in a trading sub? Spitballing obviously, don't mind either way.
