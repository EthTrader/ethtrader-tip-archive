I think people know the truth even if they don't admit it, a 90% drop speaks for itself and to think the market has it wrong is absolute insanity! There's a status quo to protect and I get that, I don't want to rock the boat anymore either but I absolutely will keep telling the truth as long as allowed. 

You're one of my favourite people Rik and people love ya, clearly!
