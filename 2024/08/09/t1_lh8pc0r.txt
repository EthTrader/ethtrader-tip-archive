I think it's all situational and moderator discretion is best approach - otherwise, you either have a no rule and shit gets spammed, or you have a a very strict duplicate rule, which would remove even more posts.

No duplicate stories with moderator discretion allows for major developments in stories to be posted - however, some developments should simply be posted as comment  to generate discussion within the existing post.

Eg. CELER bridge hacked, 1 million funds lost!!

2 hours later... new post... CELER HACKED, 3 MILLION FUNDS LOST!!

A 2nd article is not needed, the 'development' in that story can simply be discussion in the comments of the initial post.
