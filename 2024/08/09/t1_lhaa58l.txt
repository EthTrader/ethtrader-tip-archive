Well yeah I'm fairly active on Coneheads and I see you there all the time, it's the same with me I'm a fuckin' ray of light and tip everyone thousands ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)on here something just feels off, like bad intent or ill will or something.  
  
The truth is that your criticisms only get labelled as negative or attacks because you're absolutely correct almost every time and the only way anyone can dismiss your points is by being reframed as intentionally malicious when you are so obviously not doing that. It touches a nerve because of the elements of truth in there, not because what you say is wrong but a fairly reliable affirmation of the opposite. 

(Standard disclaimer, love sub love members love reddit, not unfair, not an attack not insulting etc)
