yup, and it was 100% luck!

I didn't know anything about crypto, and in 2017 started working in current job, Who re it happems 90% of employees are fanatic devs, and all they could talk about back then was eth, btc and ripple.

I wanted to impress them so I bought a lot of xrp cause it seemed very cheap, but dumped that as soon as it did 2x, thank God, I'd add

and I also startedy DCA into BTC, at the time interested the price was about $7k ðŸ¥¹

unfortunately, I didn't buy ETH, cause one of my colleagues was mining it, and had a bad experience that scared me ðŸ« 

but still, I have been so lucky they introduced me in this industry ðŸ¥¹
