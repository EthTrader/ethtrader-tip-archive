yes. I think Ray shared the links as it happened, the problem is that someone interested in believing the pump was legit won't want to hear the truth and resist instead. I can't help that but I can find all the tweets and the wallet addy that bought and dumped donuts if you want. I've commented this multiple times and get ignored so dunno if worth the effort if it's the idea itself that is unappealing and just gonna cause friction y'know?
