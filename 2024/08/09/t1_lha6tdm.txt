I checked on bricks and they have 163,639 holders on nova. Even bricks have more hodlers than donuts. I guess with the exposure of giving out donut on conehead, it'll help to invite more users here with more hodlers as well. 

Not having up to 10k hodlers is very bad for a token with a subreddit this large tbh
