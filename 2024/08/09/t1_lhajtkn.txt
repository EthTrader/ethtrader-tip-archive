ofc the will.

try to imagine something... a new users posting in this sub....

chances are their posts it's going to be deleted, for mentioning another token name even if the post is about ETH, or for not mentioning eth while talking about NFT, or for not being enough macro topic according to the discretionary standards of mods... I mean, posting here is hard for us, imagine for themðŸ˜…
