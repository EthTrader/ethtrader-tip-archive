"Donuts are tokens that represent community contribution & engagement on theÂ r/ethtrader subreddit.
Donuts can be used for additional vote weight in community polls, tipping other users, and even purchasing the top banner, which can be used for advertising."

The faster people realise what Donuts are, the better.

They work as intended. 

People expect way too much, wife changing gains, ferrari , lambo, binance listing. All jokes aside, i dont think this is the right mind set to have cause i dont think you will get this and some people realise that and leave. 

They have been created for one purpose and so far its working in the way it should.
