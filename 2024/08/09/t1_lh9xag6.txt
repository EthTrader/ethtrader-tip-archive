Been saying it for a while now. Tokenization is going to be the next catalyst for Eth and the L2s involved, such as Link.

The whole purpose of Chainlink is to build decentralized oracle networks to put real world data into the blockchain.

When RWAs finally go mainstream, Link will have its moment.

This is just another proof that ethereum has utility that expands to the real world. Institutions know this. Look at how much BlackRock invested already.

Weâ€™re still early.
