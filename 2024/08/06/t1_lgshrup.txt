Again I see it slightly different. If you are an not so active user but every now and then get 2 free hours after work you can catch up with the users who have all day long to post. Those that have all day long will just spread their posts and it won't even bother them. If you're on a more restricted time schedule but still want to catch up in your free time it's easier if you don't have these time restrictions. !tip 1
