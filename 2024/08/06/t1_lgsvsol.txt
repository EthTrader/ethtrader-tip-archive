Perhaps I'm a bit biased because I don't have all day long for posting and sometimes enjoy doing 2 posts in a free hour I got but my view (and not talking it for my own benefit only) is that the hardcore farmers and top earners will just spread their posts without any issues but someone who is busy and can't post on multiple occasions a day might benefit if he has the possibility to do his posts after work for example. 

I see the points, and it is beneficial since many people push out 3 news posts and are gone (I'm not one of them) and so we have a more spread out stream of content. But I also see how someone who doesn't have much time is limited in his posting when he gets an hour in which he'd like to do multiple posts and in that sense "catch up" with those farmers who can just post all day long.
