Np. Uniswap used to run on flux, Ethereum nodes are currently run there, and so is Aave. Wich meansâ€¦ if you want to disrupt Aave just for a moment you would have to hack or DDos 6 different locations in the world at the same timeâ€¦ because once you shut 1 locations Down another instance of the program boots up in another flux node.

Flux makes bussinesses and tools almost impossible to shut Down and 99% automated. ðŸ˜…

And Its waaaay cheaper than Google or Amazon cloud. ðŸ¤©
