Thank you for your opinion and this discussion. I think people in this community need to talk more about potential changes with friendly talk and arguments.

 I agree with you on everything you said, its just that i would be more inclined to nerf it 0.5 in the start and see the data later. Anyway, i think this proposal is the right thing to do, so this community can continue to improve.
