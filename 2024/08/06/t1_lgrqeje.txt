Tbh we're getting too many proposals lately and these proposals aren't users friendly to new users. They'll find this sub too hard to deal with and I still remember how the huge pay2post makes many people from RCC just decide to not talk or come here to post. 

The simpler it gets to new users, the more we going in Reddit ranking and the more AMAs and BANNERS and donut getting adoptions. I know we want more adoptions to donut and we're trying our possible best for spammers and those that cheat the system but at least let makes it something new users friendly.
