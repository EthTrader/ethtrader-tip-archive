They are dispicable, sure there are a handful of honest ones but in general they bought and paid for their own reputation fairly. Estate agents, politicians, advertising companies, cold callers, gambling companies, psychics. All of them fraudsters and charlitans.Â 


Literally nobody says 'f*** the firemen/nurses!' for a damn good reason, when they say f*** politicians and politics it's for a very good reason too.Â 


The ideal scenario is you're afraid, compliant, arguing amongst each other and arguing over relatively nonconsequential topics while they pump your money into the military and surveillance ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
