>Everyone has their profit taking targets. I'm not taking profits until Eth reaches $10k

That's a pretty nice plan. I've seen people shaming people for selling early which the pizza guy of bitcoin was a good example. Him buying pizza with bitcoin for his daughter was supposed to be one of the most awesome thing in the crypto space but instead we shame the dude and said he would have been rich if he would have decides to hodl. But funny enough, most people that do shame him plus me have no idea what bitcoin is at that time so it's a big shame on us too.

Like your plans on selling at 10k, if ETH in future rises to 100k in price, we'll still see lots of people shaming the ones that sell early at 10k. I love what you said, we all have our price target and let anyone do with what they want with their tokens.
