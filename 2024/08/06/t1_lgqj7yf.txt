I hope he says in our favour.

What I understand is that we should use the original link of the post from onwards. Like at the bottom in both posts, an original source was given. If we just use that link to post, then I hope there are no issues. But it's my understanding after knowing they deleted.

It's better if mods clear this because I think before they were allowed, even with that content agg. rule
