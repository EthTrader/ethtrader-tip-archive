I'm gonna be weird and through 0.33x out there xD

I'd probably support 0.5x over 0.25x - because, if its the same as comedy, then people will likely just start posting low quality memes to fill their 3 posts per day.

Content balance will often reflect reward multipliers, and I think keeping news links above comedy will keep the front page looking more relevent.
