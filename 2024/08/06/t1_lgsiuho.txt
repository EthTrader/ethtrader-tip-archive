I agree with you there. Some users are busy all day long and have 2 hours of free time after work and with the current rules they could catch up and publish their thoughts. The rule is supposed to help casuals and punish restrict hardcore farmers but it's quite the opposite imo. It sounds good but hardcore farmers who can post all day long will just spread their posts while more casual users who every now and then are inspired and want to post in their free time will get hit most. 

Also if the news spam is the issue, why wouldn't we just reduce the news multiplier? (Which is another debate, not saying that I want to reduce it).
