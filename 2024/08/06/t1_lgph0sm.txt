Good bronut. It's great to see more users are becoming aware of what paid shills are and helping keep our sub clean. Quality control is what will help increase value to DONUT later down the track too.

Sometimes we have a lapse in concentration and that's okay, we are human afterall - but it's great users like yourself have the integrity to delete sooner rather than hoping Mods don't nuke it.
