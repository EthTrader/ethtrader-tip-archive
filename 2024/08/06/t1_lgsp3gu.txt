When you say "catch up, are you referring to catching up with submitted posts? If so, let me tell you right now that it's extremely difficult, and overwhelming. For example, today, after being away for like 6/7 hours, I got online to find 42 new posts. 42.

That's an overwhelming amount of content to scroll through, much of which can be repetitive or low-quality. Implementing a longer cooldown period would help with this issue, making it easier for everyone to keep up with posts.

Or are you referring to catching up in terms of posting your own submissions to compete with fellow users? If this is the case, it's exactly the rat race mentality we're aiming to address. r/ethtrader should prioritize quality discussions, informative and high quality content over mass quantity. 

This proposal's goal is to create a more balanced environment, where users can enjoy and post content without feeling overwhelmed or pressured to compete.

I think you're a bit biased in your argument, try to think about the collective good rather than individual convenience.
