>Important news and updates might be delayed because of the longer cooldown period.

I don't think that'll really be the case, there are plenty of users online throughout the day and not every active user rushes to post 3 times every single day like clock-work.


I do think there is merit to the advantages though, if users spend a little bit more effort actually reading the articles they want to share, it should result in less posts being removed due to user negligence.

I'd give this a [YES] for now - but I would consider support an even shorter duration of 2 hours - but perhaps that is something that can be tweaked later down the track after a trial period.
