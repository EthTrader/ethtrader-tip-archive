[No] not a big fan myself. I sometimes feel inspired and do more text posts than news articles and when I feel like posting I'd like to be able to do like 2 posts in an hour and then take days off. I think the news article spam could be reduced with a different approach like reducing multipliers. We also have an activity issue and restricting the posting capabilities even more doesn't sound nice to me. We had barely any rules a while ago and now we keep changing and changing the system which I'm not the biggest fan of.
