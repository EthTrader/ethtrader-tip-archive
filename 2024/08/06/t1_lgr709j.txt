>After crashing more than 13% yesterday, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Index has recovered more than 11% in today’s trading session. This was due to a strong recovery in the US futures market

Yesterday crash wasn't a joke, so many analyst saying it was due to Japanese yen and war in the middle East. I'm so happy for the turn of event today. Hope this green market last. !tip 1
