>PolitiFi represents a new wave of meme coins in the cryptocurrency industry, blending political satire with financial speculation. These coins draw inspiration from political figures, events, and ideologies, often in a satirical manner. Examples include Doland Tremp (TREMP) and Kamala Horris (KAMA), which are based on U.S. election candidates
