Crabbing means extended periods of time with no volume, no spikes in activity, horizontal movement, flat linear with no volatility.Â 


None of those apply to that chart. There has been volume, spikes, ups and downs, volatility and extended non linear activity long term.


This chart also does not show the 6c peak and unsure why, that definitely happened.


I do agree the price is the same as last year.
