>And do election posts have it? 

Some election posts do have relevant marco-economic components, but not all of them. Some political posts do get removed.

Many scammer/hacker posts get removed to if they are focusing more on an individual rather than a large significant business.

End of the day, ask yourself if the article has direct content relating to Ethereum or ERC20 tokens or Macro-ecnomic factors, if no, it'll likely get removed.
