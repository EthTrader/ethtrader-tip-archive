I think we could still discuss if all donuts would be burnt or if this only accounts for small tips.

If someone tips you 1 donut, or let’s say between 1-5 donut they could be burnt IMO, since you’d be eligble for donuts from the DAO anyway.

But what about big tips? People like Aminok tend to do big tips. E.g., 50 or 500 donut. In that case I don’t think it would make sense to burn them. The intention there is to actually hand over a big tip.

But, most tips are just !tip 1, so I think burning those could be a good idea. It would have little to no impact on the receiver as he’d be eligible for donut from the DAO. At least the impact would be small as long as the ratios are high.

So, I’d say yes but I think we should discuss different tresholds

!tip 1
