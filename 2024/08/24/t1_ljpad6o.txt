ETH/DONUT chart gives a better detail then purely looking at a DONUT chart.  


My point is that the rules in the last 3 months is observation bias, rather than a direct reflection of the "rules changing the sub" to the price - and that DONUT would have slowly dipped no matter what, due to such a significant pump in the first place.  


We can see, since the well before the RCP hype, DONUT/ETH ratio is MUCH more in DONUT's favour, relative to 12-15 months ago.
