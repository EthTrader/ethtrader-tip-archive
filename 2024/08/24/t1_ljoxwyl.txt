There's always sell pressure before distro and I'm against selling penalties. You want organic growth uninhibited by rules.


Find a way to get people to want to buy Donut.


The complecated rules backfire most of the time, look at how many changes there have been lately. Half the members left and the token is 90% down. Should be a bit more reluctant to keep doing those things when it's losses like this.
