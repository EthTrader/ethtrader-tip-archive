The price of DONUT before it "spiked" due to the noticeable change in the ToS which then lead to RCP's being listed was ranging between 0.0007 to 0.001

It's currently ranging between 0.006 to 0.009 iin the last couple of months... you keep talking about how it's down so much, but the fact is, from before the circumstance that caused to to pump hard, it's still at a much higher range.

I would speculate, with or without rule changes, DONUT was going to continue on a downtrend until it found a floor - which is still significantly higher than the what it was before it pumped.
