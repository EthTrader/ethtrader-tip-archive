>Crypto whales significantly influence the market with their strategic purchases and sales of altcoins. Last week, they focused on three altcoins: MATIC, which saw a 33% increase in value due to a renaming event; Litecoin (LTC), with a 141% increase in net inflow from large investors, indicating potential accumulation; and Ethereum (ETH), where whale purchases helped push the price above $2,700

Yes thank you whales, so after the price pump to a certain level, you'll dump on us right?
