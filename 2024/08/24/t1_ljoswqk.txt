>A major Uniswap investor reactivated their wallet after six months, withdrawing 1.48 million UNI tokens worth $10.4 million from Coinbase Prime. The wallet now holds 3.91 million UNI tokens valued at $27.2 million. This includes 3 million UNI tokens withdrawn in February and August 2024 at about $6.89 each, and 911,000 UNI tokens unlocked from the Uniswap treasury in September 2020 and transferred in February 2024 at $7.74 each

Okay but on a serious note, how tf did this whales just forgot their holding and comes back to it after a long time? It wouldn't matter if it was bull or bear, they just sell or keep transferring it to an exchange. It looks sketchy asf
