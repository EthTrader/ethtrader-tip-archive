You and me both lol. I’m becoming somewhat skeptical about a bull run too. At least any time soon. I just don’t know where the capital will come from. People are totally skint and if you take off your crypto tinted glasses, you’ll see the public perception of crypto these days is really bad. Quite a sad state of affairs really.
