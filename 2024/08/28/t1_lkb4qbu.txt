not sure, I was hoping to win one with the tweet on X first, but nope ðŸ« 

then I considered the LP, but it's volatile, I mean I put 25k donuts there for the membership, and the effect vanish as soon as the position goes below 25k donuts, then comes back when your position goes up again....

maybe I'll buy that later, need to understand first if standard emojis like this ðŸ¥¹ are allowed for users with no membership, cause the Reddit ones aren't.

can you see this message with these emojis? ðŸ‘€
