Exactly mate, everything is super stressy at the moment and nobody has money here.. when retail fomo'd in last time I think retail had money to fomo with, whereas now we've had lockdowns and austerity, wars and a cost of living crisis haha. It's not the same and in lots of ways it's worse.Â 


I'm optimistic constantly and won't be selling a single sat any time but it's so tempting to sell everything and disappear!
