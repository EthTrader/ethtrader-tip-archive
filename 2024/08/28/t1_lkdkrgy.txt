Yeah, the economical landscape is so different now. Folk just haven’t got the disposable income to invest in anything never mind something as high risk as crypto. I don’t want to sound like a doom merchant but I fear it will get worse before it gets better. 

I’ve no plans to sell either but I think when the market picks up again and I hit some price targets   I’ll be exiting the space for good.
