>The Brett (BASED) memecoin, inspired by Pepe coin and built on the BASE chain, is projected to potentially reach a high of $0.200 by 2024 and could surge to $0.825 by 2030. Amid market volatility, Brett's price has recently dropped, but a bullish market could lead to significant gains.

I guess the price to .2 is possible but .825 by 2030 depends on the marketing and community
