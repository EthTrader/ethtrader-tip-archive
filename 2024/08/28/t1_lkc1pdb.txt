That's something we still don't know yet. Airline has been doing great in doing the marketing and maybe if we see someone twice as him, we'll definitely see more people in here.

The last DEX listing brings in people here which makes donut rises and I think the premium membership is also a big starts.

They'll as well be a cool down 3hours to post and news link will as well be reduced which might make people post something more eye catching

I think it might be slow at the moment but the marketing strategies and the proposal is getting the sub on the right track. Let hope for the best
