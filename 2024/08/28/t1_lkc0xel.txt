I'm usually a little off, so double check the numbers and I won't make any definitive claims to prevent any snarky got ya replies ðŸ¤£ (joke)


People want to buy tokens that will go up and make profit. If they don't buy then they don't think the price will increase, no matter how loud the 25 active farmers are.Â 


The increased sushi pool incentives were good, to entice people to LP.Â Â Vote bonus was good, competitions for free donuts, raise a treasury and hinting at a cex listing, get the treasury to spend it's coffers buying Donuts like Coneheads hinted at, stop letting farmers earn so many for free so they have to buy, introduce incentives to hold, incentives to buy back sold donuts, bonus donuts for buying donuts on chain, keep allowing donut tips in other subs but expand it, increase utility for the coin, increase things that can only be done by buying donut like memberships.Â 


I can go on like this forever haha.
