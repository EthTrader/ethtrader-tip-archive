Interesting! In terms of the goals and values of a subreddit, you want more people, quality engagements, positive interactions, all of that stuff so yeah posts like that are great.


Personally all I saw was bickering, complaining from unregistered people spreading negativity on the daily like I do sometimes which doesn't seem to be in line with any of the interests of a subreddit but they aren't earning either.


I dont know why I type these things it makes it seem like I care loads and i dont, so weird ðŸ˜…
