No rule necessary. Just follow your own morales and values.

For example, I don't tip posts which I know should be removed, such as duplicates or paid shills. I don't tip comedy posts that are low quality and simply not funny.

If you choose to not tip users that have sold more than  50% of their DONUT, that's your own choice to make - but not something that should be a global penalty created by the DAO.
