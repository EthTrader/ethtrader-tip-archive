>Thruster Finance, a key liquidity provider in the Blast ecosystem, has seen its Total Value Locked (TVL) drop to $199.87 million, the lowest since March, reflecting broader struggles within the Blast network

>The downturn contrasts with industry leaders like Lido Finance, MakerDAO, and Aave, which have significantly higher TVLs and offer more robust services

It's not easy to keep up with these industry leaders, and besides, market is currently down. It gonna have a higher TVL soon
