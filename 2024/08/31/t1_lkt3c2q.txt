you always get all the tipped donuts, it's just the bonus you give others that is less if you have less than 20k governance score.

I don't think is fair too, as several other bronuts..A few of them also proposed to cancel this weight system but the community voted for keeping it, so I guess some people think is fair.

plus, it is an incentive to hold donuts, so some users like it for this reason, imo
