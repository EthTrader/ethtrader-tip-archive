Pretty much. I guess to an extent the bitcoin halving certainly has an impact, but personally i think the 4 year cycle has just as much impact on the US elections, the year leading up to the election often has more uncertainty and volatility, and, while it's not a guarantee, and could be coincidental, there appears to be some more positive sentiment the year after... coincidently, that's the year after bitcoin halvings take place too.
