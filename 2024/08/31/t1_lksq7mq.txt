The world is full of bad actors and more when money is involved but the good things humans have is that our brain automatically tries to hold on to something positive to be able to move forward. That thing can be, TA, just hope, beliefs, etc.

If humans didn't have that mechanism well, we wouldn't be here because we just need to open a little bit our eyes to see all the bad stuff around us. And yes, even if we think "it's not that bad", it is our automatic mechanism working again.

Anyway, I believe some red is coming in the coming months but future is still bright. How I know? Market cycles.
