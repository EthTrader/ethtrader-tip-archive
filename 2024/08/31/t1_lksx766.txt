Michael Saylor would say: "There is no second best."

Personally I think his view is narrow-minded and disregards some of the great developments other crypto projects are bringing to the market. I own more than just Bitcoin.

But as far as the wider market goes, the facts you describe suggest that BTC is still a favorite & that alt season has not yet arrived. You will know that alt season is here once you see a considerable drop in BTC dominance. I'm convinced it will happen.
