>Uniswap (UNI), a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) token, has 50.8% of its total supply held by the top 10 wallets. While Uniswap boosts itself on decentralization, especially in its governance, the concentration of tokens among large holders could significantly influence the decision-making process.

Though Uniswap is well established and a leading Dex, this is an issue. Five out of the top 10 wallets can decimate the entire marketcap, if they decide to sell. If this was a newly created token, smart investors won't go anywhere near it.
