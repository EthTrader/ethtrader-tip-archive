Build your own ATM xD

That is what I did during the week of the hack. I need to create a diagram now to have everything more clear.

Also, if you have Google Drive, I suggest you to share all your google drive with a secret gmail account. This way you dont lose .gsheet files and you can recover them.

I lost my Reddit blocked list CSV and all my crypto csv generation files. Today I have to create the Binance one to accumulate the "stakings" etc.
