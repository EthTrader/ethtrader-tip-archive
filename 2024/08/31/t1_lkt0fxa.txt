donuts are no longer earned through karma, but through tips.

basically if you want to reward people with donuts now you can't just upvote them, but tipping them domuts too.

those you tip will receive the tipped donuts + the bonus of this *Tip2Vote* system.

BUT

not all the users have the same tip weight. Tip weight (that varies from 0 and 1) is only = 1 if you have at least 20k governance score 

not that easy to explain, I hope I helped a tiny bit at least xD
