Correct my friend, made a few good trades but only ever by watching what others do and then trading against them. A wallet used to pump and dump all the time so I used to just wait and do the opposite, all gravy until they stopped trading for some reason and just held equal amounts of eth and donut so now I dunno what to do ðŸ¤” lol
