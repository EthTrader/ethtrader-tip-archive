Hmm fair point but I didn't think him getting caught has stuff to do with the freedom of speech. Like what Lordcider said yesterday, telegram was just like the darkweb of the normal internet (people do what they want on the platform) which they say telegram is in support of cyber bullying, drug trafficking etc. 

Elon talks about free speech but I'm very sure he won't tolerate someone cyber bullying his love ones on his own platforms
