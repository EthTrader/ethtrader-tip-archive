Donut is a governance token, as much as I believe in donut, I love swapping it for ETH and Solana(i know I wasn't supposed to be saying SOL in ETH sub lol). But I really enjoy collecting donut and holding some amount of it but I prefer swapping it with ETH and Solana. Donut is just a governance token that might rise in future or might notðŸ¤·
