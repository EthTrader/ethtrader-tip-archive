It's been a rollercoaster. I felt the pain of ruggit in full force but I found, I guess you can say, a support group here, laughing and meme about it. I was here when the first Bitcoin ETFs were released and the euphoria we all were despite what happened to moons. I felt the joy of finally being reworded for the farming when donut hit 6c together with you all. It was pretty great but now this place no longer feels the same as it used to be.
