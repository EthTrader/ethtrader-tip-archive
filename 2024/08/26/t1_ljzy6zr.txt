T h fast fingers isn't my thing and those exchange listing DOGs, I didn't have the account. I don't use binance, bybit or OKX. I only use kraken and MEXC. So I only withdraw dogs to my telegram wallet. 

If the price went well, I'll sell but if it doesn't, I'll just hodl

I hope you're ready though
