Whilst the intention is good, and it would be great to have more quality in conversation, people can fluff out comments so they have lengthy comments which still have no substance. I don't see this really having a positive change to the sub.

An alternative idea would be to implement something similar to what r/cc had, in the [SERIOUS] tag - where comments within [SERIOUS] tagged posts were removed by automod if they didn't have 100 characters minimum.  Both post and comment multipliers in [SERIOUS] posts were also worth x2 - and subject to stricter moderation that removed padded out fluff comments.
