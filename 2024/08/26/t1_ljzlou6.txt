Not really, anyone aware of a pool is free to deposit their assets and provide liquidity. It's likely some "non bronuts" will withdraw their position once the Arbitrum rewards end, but, it is what it is. The only other option would be to do something like award "bronuts" who are providing liquidity with other perks, such a free special membership (wink wink, nudge nudge)
