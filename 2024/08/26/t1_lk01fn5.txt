Tipping comments/posts is how the DONUT token gets distributed by the Treasury every month.

Data is taken by how many tips people receive, and then DONUT is distributed based on said statistics. 

I think in cones you get tokens based on how many upvotes your post gets, but in this sub, it's based on tips.
