>Make sure not to swap all your donuts. Keep some for the future 

Yeah thanks :)

I have some donuts and other coins with moons on a wallet I've never connected to web3 sites. This wallet I always connect to vote on governance pool here and on RCC and who knows what might happen if those sites got hacked. 

So I'll just have to keep some donuts in this wallet to have some governance power but won't keep my life savings in here. Just might thinking though, because I never trust anything or websites😁 I just like following my guts
