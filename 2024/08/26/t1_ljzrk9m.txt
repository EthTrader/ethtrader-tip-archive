Certainly a combination of factors.

1) There were 200k DONUT allocated to Honeyswap, whereas Sushi only has 150k - due to general changes rebalancing things.

2) There was a lot more trading volume happening on during those momnths, due to hype about the Arbitrum migration, as well as the previous hype from RCP's being listed on Kraken, following by the volatility that came with dumps from the Sunset and buy-backs.

3) There might be more TVL in Sushi.com, which means rewards get spread amongst more users split of the pool.
