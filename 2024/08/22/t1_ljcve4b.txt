I doubt it'll change much, it's such a subtle nerf to the multiplier, and news is just very easy to post.

The one to watch is if AI content becomes allowed again... if it does, nobody will do any quality control over the content they're posting and we will end up seeing more low quality articles again.

I've been back and forth on that one, but ultimately I believe we need to maintain some level of content standards are not allow 100% AI produced content.
