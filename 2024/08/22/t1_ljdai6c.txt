As far as I love this predictions and wanted it to happen... I doubt it gonna happen even 5years to come but who knows.

The current marketcap for ETH is at $317.57B and total marketcap for the whole crypto market is $2.16T so if ETH has a mcap of $1T, it'll make it have more than 40% of the total crypto marketcap, which is likely not possible
