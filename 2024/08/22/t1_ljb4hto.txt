Official Governance proposal has been supported to allow funding on contests.✅

I created a sentiment poll, receiving support from the community, nominating myself to take on the contest master role. ✅

From my perspective; I'm waiting for formal approval - or direction from the mod team to begin running contests, and information about the process in how DONUT/CONTRIB is awarded - (I assume I would communicate with MattG - and potentially include rewards with the end of round snapshot?)
