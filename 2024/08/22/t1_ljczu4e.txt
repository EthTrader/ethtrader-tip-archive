Not sure. 0.75 seems like a good healthy balance... 

I would consider a proposal  which nerfed news links to 0.33 + allowed AI generated news. That would then require about 7 tips to break even, whiich most people get anyway.

But, I'd rather see quality over quantity, and have a higher multiplier with less AI.
