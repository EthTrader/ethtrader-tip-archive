Theyre both related to how people manage and show their identities. An anonymous society is about complete anonymity and privacy so people are basically obscuring their identity. Multidimensional identity is more about managing different parts of the identity - people can choose how much or little of their identity to reveal. Hope that makes sense I could be wrong tho !tip 1
