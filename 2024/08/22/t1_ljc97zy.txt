Well, back in 2022 I expected a pre-halving run up, a post halving dip and then months of crabbing at a range. I then expect a slight uptrend in Q4 2024, followed by 2025 following similar pattern to 2021.

So, I'm expecting some volatity, I'll keep buying some dips if there are decent dump days - in the meantime, I'm just staking and waiting, watching everyone else get emotional and panic.
