I don't see an issue with our current rulings; most users are already screening their news content now. The main reason why posts are being removed are because they are duplicates, and the 2nd main reason is because they are not Ethereum or macro related... so, the users have adapted to the current AI rules, so, I'm happy to vote for no change to that.
