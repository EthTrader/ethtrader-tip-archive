>Former President Donald Trump appeared to promote an “official” cryptocurrency project using his name in a Truth Social post on Thursday

>Trump’s son Eric previously teased a “big announcement” around cryptocurrency and DeFi in a post on X on Aug. 6. The Telegram channel Trump linked to was created the same day and it quickly started gaining subscribers on Thursday, with almost 30,000 an hour after Trump posted about it.

>Before Trump’s Truth Social post, the Telegram group ran a giveaway for Telegram Premium subscriptions and welcomed subscribers to “the only official Telegram channel for the Trump DeFi project!”

This shows that these politicians only love their pocket. Imagine daddy and son doing some promoting shit about their coins that they'll see gain from it. Same gain trump did with its NFTs
