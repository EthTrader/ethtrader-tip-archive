This surge in private transactions, aimed at MEV protection, has led to increased gas usage per transaction and affected ETH's base fees due to the 2021 EIP-1559 upgrade. The volatility in base fees, driven by the high gas consumption of private transactions, poses challenges for network users, particularly affecting smaller builders struggling with the increased cost

So, users are using private transactions with an increased gas fees, just to protect the network from MeV bots? ðŸ™„
Sounds unconvincing to me.
