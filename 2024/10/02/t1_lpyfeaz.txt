There's a game going on to make a post about ETH price prediction and I'm thinking of how many users will participate. Even though the contest was winning donuts, and I'm sure they'll be few users that'll participate.

Even if you reduce link post multiplier, it won't stop people from posting link as link is more easier to post than making original post. But whatever people say, I'm in but I don't think reducing link multiplier will solve anything.
