You´re right it´s over 90% link spam. People want easy Donuts. 1x for text post isn´t an incentive because you will need about 30 minutes to write a post. You get 0.75x for 3 minute link search. 

That´s not an incentive for improvements of the sub. We shouldn´t lower links 0.75% but we should higher text posts to 1.25x
