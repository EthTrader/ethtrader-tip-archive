By limiting link posts we would encourage text posts indeed. But at the same time limiting text posts to a maximum of 1 per day counteracts that same initiative. The 2 links per day limit could coexist with no limit (other than the 3 per day) for text posts. So a user who wants to push out 3 high effort text posts a day and no link spam could do so. !tip 1
