You believe or not, I'm getting 3x times more 🍩 than older system. I never thought to be in the top 20 with the old system.

Even though I stopped posting very early, wen downvoting was at peak and was hard to make even 10k 🍩 with only comments.

I voted in favour because I knew that it is a good chance for me to avail posts benefits.
