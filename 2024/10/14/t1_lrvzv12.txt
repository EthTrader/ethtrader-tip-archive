Like fr.... Saying a user earning 40k donut is too much. Why will it be too much? If donut was at the price of bitcone, we can't come up with that idea.

Now let imagine in future after the proposal passes and a top user earn 15k donut and donut price was $0.6 at that time, they'll be proposal to reduce donut earning as well because 15k donut is too much lmao.

I'm not a top earner myself and I don't see problems with people earning 40k. With so many rules to prevent spamming to earn free money, some people are still working hard to earn as much as to earn more.

I'll ABSTAIN for now as well
