IÂ´m from Germany and I can say you that our government destroyed many things with their green ideology. Many of them. Also many costs and a big problem is the ayslum policy. 

Many of our politician went into politics straight from school and don't even have any training. I think politicians should learn their office. Our economics minister said that a company that no longer produces is not bankrupt, it simply no longer produces. 

Far from reality. A company has to file for bankruptcy (otherwise it will delay bankruptcy, that is punishable) and if it doesn't produce, it can't pay anyone. There will be new elections next year and I hope something changes.
