Sadly, no newbies have entered the pool, and given some of the risks, II don't blame them! Some weekly updates are in a worse position than the earlier week.

But, that's what these posts aim to do, educate people to allow them to make informed decisions.

It would be good to get that buy pressure to increase, so we can experience more healthy trading in and out though. Airlines next job! xD
