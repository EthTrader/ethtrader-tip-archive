It goes a bit against free markets to set earning limits and broadly speaking, top earners provide more & better content than others. Should you have the feeling that this is untrue, then it is a community tipping problem.

Sometimes I find banalities and short snappy answers get appreciated way too much. I don't quite understand it. And other long and thoughtful contributions leave the feed without any tips.

We as community need to sharpen our radar for contributions that are actually valuable to the discussion. Sometimes that may even be those contrary to our own opinions. They are valuable because they challenge our way of thinking, contrary to the echo chamber comments that are the popular standard.



But what you are saying about top users earning & selling & earning & selling is also true.

I think a hard cap may not be the right solution. Instead a system where it gets progressively harder to earn could be designed to spread the monthly earnings a bit wider.
