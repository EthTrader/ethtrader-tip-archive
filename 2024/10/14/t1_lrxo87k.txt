Never heard of Puffer before outside of a type of jacket. Staking any amount is already super easy and many cex have all kinds of protection against slashing, dudes like Coinbase absolutely know how destructive for reputation it could be. So this one boils down to trusting an unheard of company over one of the way more established ones, it could be worth taking the risk and it could backfire. Very hard to know.
