Ive always been a believer - For 4 years Ive been accumulating. I always believed in Vitalik but this year was not it for me. Mainly because of this flood of Layer 2s. Im not an expert Im just a guy on the internet who works from home but I think Ethereum should focus more on scaling the mainnet instead of relying heavily on Layer 2s. The abundance of L2s fragments the network - because it reduces activity on the mainnet which in turn slows deflation as weve seen lately. Launching a Layer 2 shouldnt be as easy as creating a new Facebook page - it risks spreading resources too thin and losing the value of Ethereum. Thats just my take but who am I anyways !tip 1
