Yep, it's not much at all, but I would still say it was worth it.

I spent maybe $1.20 in gas fees all up, and used mostly ThrusterFinance or Bladeswap to trade USDB to ETH back and forth to increase my ETH balance. In the meantime, either asset was passively accruing points towards the airdrop.

I would've done the same thing on any other network - so, it's a worthwhile bonus in my eyes!
