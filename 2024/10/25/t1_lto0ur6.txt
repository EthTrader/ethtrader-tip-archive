I actually don't see how this is any different to current interpretations.

As of now, if I was to post a picture of a chart, that would be Media - but if I was to post a picture of a chart, and with 200 words plus, as required by diiscussion, add my own analysis/feedback - that would qualify under a different flair (be it trading, technicals, strategy, discussion etc)

500 words of original insights using said image would qualify it for original content.

IMO - same applies for a Tweet. I'm sharing just a tweet, it gets the media flair, if I'm adding 200 words of my own content, would it not already qualify for a text based flair?

We already have rules in place that restrict posts that are copy/pasted, plagiarized or AI.
