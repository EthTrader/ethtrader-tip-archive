In a perfect world this would be a great idea, im just afraid this will become meta for farming. This also creates more work for mods. I think we should go on the path that decreases farming donuts in the sub, like nerfing links even more or maybe reducing donut distribution number overall. This will create healthy environment where farming is not a priority, its just a bonus. 

But i have to say that i like the idea of creating your own content with X posts. 

What i would do is nerf links to 0.3 and set 0.6 for self written posts using X posts as a source
