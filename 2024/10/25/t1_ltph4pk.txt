Tbh, from what I have observed over the years, users on YouTube mostly want to watch content that promises them 100x returns in a few weeks. I have seen many YouTubers who create truly valuable content yet struggle to gain followers or attract endorsements and paid advertisements. Meanwhile those who shill misleading content, often fcuking their viewers trust are making thousands.

Recently I watched a video explaining blockchain oracles and most of the comments were along the lines of "which coin to buy for maximum returns" and some crazy other shits

Now you need to decide which path to take. Create quality content for a select few viewers or create content with a jaw dropping thumbnail shilling the next 100x dog coin. Itâ€™s up to you.
