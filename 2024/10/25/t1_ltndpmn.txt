>Unlike Binance’s BNB and Coinbase’s Base, Ink will not release its own token. Instead, the chain will focus on building robust DeFi infrastructure and added functionality for Kraken’s exchange. This way, Kraken avoids dealing with the complexity of tokenomics and the risk that a volatile token might hurt its reputation. 

You just gotta love Kraken for this well-thought approach. Proves Kraken is motivated by solutions not greed right BigPops?
