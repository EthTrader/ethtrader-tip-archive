it's true & the wise ones knows is it the 1st, "many company's stocks", "brands" & "services sector" is a bubble so gdp itself is a bubble!  just look at the giant dept n the US, japan, most EU countries, no need to b a genius to realize that no no one is gonna pay it back just pretend u r doing so & try to make people look away every year u grow that debt to even crazier levels, printing green papers for other nations resources from oil & minerals to everything else won't work for ever! & then what ? bomb them ? what's happening is stupid, crazy, evil & won't lead us to anywhere good, i think it's gonna b the 1930 recession "that lead to ww2", i think it's a wen question & myself i would say it's within 1 to 25 years from now.
