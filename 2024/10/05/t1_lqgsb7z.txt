Yep, I have a decent bag of ZK.

ZK was only launched a few months ago, so, it's not exactly screaming of bagholders like old tokens such as LRC or MATIC are.

It's only 50% down from it's initial airdrop value as well, considering the state of the markets, that suggests it should certainly recover and exceed it's launch value when the bull run comes.

I'm pretty bullish on the network itself, ZK Rollups are pretty new, but I think they will overtake Optimistic rollups in the long run..
