Text submissions already have bonuses, as they receive the full multiplier compared to links, self stories, comedy and media posts, which are penalized. Also, the Original Content flair rewards authors with double points, so high quality, in-depth posts do have an advantage.

The real issue isn't the system itself, but the mindset of the user-base. Many users rush through farming without spending time engaging with quality posts. That's the problem.

To address this, we either need to disincentivize link spamming altogether, or promote higher standards that will make the feed less cluttered with low-effort submissions.
