>Create Weekly Pinned Trading Post with comments not eligible for Donut rewards and not eligible for 50 comments limit but allowing all kind of crypto project trading.

I believe allowing all kind of crypto project trading will give the sub and donut more visibility. I'm also in support of no rewards and penalty. No reward locks out farmers, ensuring that only people who have passion for trading have great conversations.
