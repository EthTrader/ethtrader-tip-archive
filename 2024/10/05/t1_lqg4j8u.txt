Thanks for pointing that out. I'm working on some self-written quality posts that I'll put out these days. Thought this still might be interesting for newer users. On a side note: I really wish we would reward high quality posts more genuinely. The times I tried to do deep dives into protocols for example, I felt that it gets even less attention than the normal link spam for farming. I'm just a bit concerned and hope we find a way (as a community) to reward and push for quality and not that everybody leaves once the "easier link spamming" gets less and less easy (of which I'm guilty as well partially). 

It'd be amazing to have a high quality space WITH good amounts of activity. Which I guess is hard to obtain but I'll do my part. !tip 1
