I agree and definitely think that topic limiter is an overkill. And activity has clearly suffered. Tip to vote was okay. But we are adding rule on top of rule and there is no need for a topic limiter imo. I'd be happy to read more genuine posts about the same topics/ different perspectives. Just watch at the daily, we got like 10% of the comments we used to have.
