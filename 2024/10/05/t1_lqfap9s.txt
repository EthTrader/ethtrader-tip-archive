Not sure about the 50 comment cap for the thread. It can be abused again by some users which will then again lead to interpretation of mods to guess which comments actually are related to trading and which are not.

Since the daily is not congested anymore we can use same thread for trading or anything else we need.

Also people who are really interested in trading can always make a post about it.
