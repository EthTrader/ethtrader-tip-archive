Totally agree with you on this. We are becoming an echo chamber because of all these rules. I don't really feel like engaging here as much as I used to. The excess of rules really caused people to be more thoughtful about their comments, but this place looks boring af to me now. At least we are still 20 people. When I started commented here there were like just 3 or 4 lol
