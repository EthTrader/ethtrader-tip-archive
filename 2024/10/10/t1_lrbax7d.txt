>wanna know why tho,

I don't really care about things even IRL activities as well and my friends abuse me with it. Not that voting doesn't matter but if I do vote and my vote doesn't count, it ain't really my business tbh.

I can't vote for a very long time and I've asked but no response so I'll leave it as it is. Not that having govt power really matters to me, I don't make proposal and if my nomination doesn't work, so shall it be. 

So far I can vote and collect rewards on every proposal, I care less about any other things going on with govt command
