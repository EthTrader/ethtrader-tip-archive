Another airdrop, another group of people who will whinge and complain they didn't earn more money.

I guess, a the end of the day, it would be better for PR if networks didn't announce seasons or airdrops, or even a token, and simply announced a snapshot with eligibility criteria, like ARB did.

Still gonna get people who miss out or receive less though.
