You're welcome! Parroting only positive stuff doesn't work, getting actual information is difficult because of bias towards wanting our moonshots to pay out.   
  
It's a major flaw in the whole reddit ecosystem in my mind, definitely nothing personal but there's a low % chance this goes anywhere but down no matter what anyone does, exactly the same as any high risk crypto. Just depends how much time, money and energy folk here are willing to risk wasting.  
  
I haven't traded for a while now but I found it more profitable than engaging, just a nightmare taxwise
