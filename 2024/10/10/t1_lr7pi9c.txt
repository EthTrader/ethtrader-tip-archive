[Automod] Meta & Donut

> Mitosis is rewarding a whole heap of Eth based stuff, any chance the guys running Donut on ARB wanna get involved and get more cross chain?

Not sure if theres much short term plan for venturing to other chains, but it's a thought for our Dev and Marketing team for sure.

Even just on Arbitrum, it would be cool to run some sort of campaign on a site like Galxe, Intract or Layer3 - but of course, all things come at a cost!

u/Friendly-Airline2426 can probably shed more insights - and the last 12 months has seen the introduction of more active mods/devs/marketing.

But we have had a lot of developments this year, from the migration to Arbitrum, the re-introduction of special memberships, the post-of-the-week campaign, and more advertisers hosting AMA's and renting banner space. But there are still some older, untouched things on the dashboard like those Donut NFT's - which again could be developed into a cool Donut/NFT Marketplace xD
