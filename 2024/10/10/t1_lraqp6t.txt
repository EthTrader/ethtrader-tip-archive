It makes a lot of sense to reward people who have earned & held tokens with governance power. They are not only the bedrock of the community but also have demonstrated their commitment to the project.

There is a lot of risk in the alternative model of letting people buy voting power. So the system we have does make sense.

That said, I'd like to draw a comparison to buying shares in a company. Sometimes it can be beneficial if an entity buys a significant amount of influence, especially if it allows to realize synergies.

How would we, how would the DAO position itself if DEXs or CEXs or other platforms would come up with a beneficial plan for us but would like some voting power in the DONUT project / the Ethtrader sub? Would we deny these experienced players out of principal? Is there even the possibility transfer voting rights?

This discussion left me wondering.
