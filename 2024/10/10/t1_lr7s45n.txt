I think nowadays if you are a new project/layer 2 the ARB strategy is unlikely to work out, unless you are BASE

When ARB came out it was one of the first layer 2s. For a new project you're competing with 69 Layer 2s, basically if you don't do the PR strategy of farming your project is likely to be a ghost chain from the get go since nobody would bother trying your network out 'organically' with all the oversaturation in the space
