In my opinion all we need is: Reddit upvote system (everyone is familar with it), 2 or 3 posts in 24h, 3 hour cooldown, delete double posts rule and that´s all. 

We should focus on growth. Otherwise, Donut will be a worthless governance token with additional rules to make posting more difficult, which will only serve to harm the sub and will never get above 1c again.   

I tell you we will recover in 3 months back to the old number of over 700+ members in a distribution instead of about 240 now.

Let´s make r/ethtrader great again.
