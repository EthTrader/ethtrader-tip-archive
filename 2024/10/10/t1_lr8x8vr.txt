I did understood your post. But DAO works totally different than the real world voting system. There are downsides to DAO in most cases like where token count is considered, which can be easily bought. But in Ethtrader it depends on the Contrib and the longer you have contributed to the sub the more power you gain, which kinda seems perfectly balanced.
