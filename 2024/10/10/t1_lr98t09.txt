Good I get your point and I love how we've all concluded and see how this many rules has affected the sub.

For the past 5months, everytime I see new proposal, I just be like OK another one. No one actually do talk about how the proposal is affecting the sub before.... Out of all the proposal that was proposed, it's few that's relevant and the rest is just forgotten 

Governance proposal is good but having 8 or more proposals per rounds just feels as if we're just trying to propose anything that comes to our mind just because we have the power to do so.

At this point and if we keep continuing with this, we'll definitely have much fewer members unlike before. I hope we find something to fixed it
