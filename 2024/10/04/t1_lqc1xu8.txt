Cool, thanks for all the good alpha always btw. Learned a lot from you. Check out Avantis if you haven't yet. They have some solid investors and have a good product in the RWA space. If you lock USDC (you can also just deposit without locking) you get around 15% apy. + It's pretty easy to rank up. And you'd be decently early. Funding is just 4M as of now, but another round might happen down the round.
