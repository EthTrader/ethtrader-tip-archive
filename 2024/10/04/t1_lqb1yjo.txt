It wouldn't be a super exciting guide, thhe cheapest place to buy KOI would be on KOI Finance! xD

It's also listed on Syncswap and MEXC... so, that's potentially another bonus... if ZKSync grows, and KOI happens to get listed on CDC, Coinbase or Binance, that would be big!

I might look at doing more "exploring ZkSync" posts though.
