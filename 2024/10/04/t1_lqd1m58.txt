agree, for a new user after getting a couple of posts deleted + feeling his/her comments/posts isolated & invisible due to the voting power where most want a vote back for their votes & a new user simply can't provide that, so staying for 2 or 3 weeks will b a super rare thing & makes the community shrinking rather than expanding
