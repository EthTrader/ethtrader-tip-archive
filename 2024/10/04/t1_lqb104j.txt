Just one of the many mysteries... or one of the original concepts that simply hasn't changed since DONUT was created 5-6 years ago.

It likely would have stemmed from the fact that the original pay2post cost was 250 DONUTs flat rate.

But even r/cc in the early days found everyone was makiing posts, and not commenting, so r/cc added a 2x multiplier for comments to encourage more discussion.

I imagine the opposite was the case here 6 years ago, there would have been a lack of posts.

Personally, one single reward allocation makes more sense to me, and you can tinker with submission multipliers to balance contributions as best deemed suitable.
