We have less spam, due double posts are not allowed. 20 active people will be only 10 soon. This sub feels emptier from day to day. People are also here to chill from fiatnam. But more stress will create more avoidance.

I personally think that we have enough regulations and don't need more restrictions, rather relief.

If I were new here, I wouldn't stay long with all these rules. What keeps me here are the active bronuts. Otherwise I wouldn't be active here anymore.
