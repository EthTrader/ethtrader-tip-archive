>The fact they did it without voting was the red flag.

or was it? i mean most of the people want to vote with the majority so they dont get targeted for their different opinion , their wallet address are easily traced back to them..

Even if it was a voting dao , we could have done nothing .. 2 votes can change the entire sub vote even if entire sub voted against it
