If the turmoil wasn't noticeable in the daily, I don't know what was. Maybe some will try it for a week. But when they can't find anything else to post, the screaming starts again.  
  
It's a rat race. The early ones in the day are getting the posts until the limit is reached.   
  
We'll be digging our own grave if things continue like this here with new rules.
