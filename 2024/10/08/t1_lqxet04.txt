I feel it should be done based on the each L2 Tokens separately given how vast the ecosystem has grown. 

Example;  
Arbitrum - 3 Posts  
Base - 3 Posts  
Optimism - 2 Posts  
Polygon - 2 Posts  
Other L2s - 2 Posts each..

There are more things happening on Layer2s compared to the mainnet itself.

If there are more restrictions on posting about L2s on an Ethereum sub, then perhaps we should go back to the sketch board again.
