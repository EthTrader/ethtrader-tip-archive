Thanks for the words, always kind rikbronut

I'm following my instinct. Hopefully I'm wrong and this turns out well for everybody, but it saddens me to see things moving this way. I was here when donuts were trading at their all-time low, when MrPuma and I were literally the only people who commented here, and now I see we are heading back at full speed to the dark ages again. Once more, hopefully I am wrong, but my investor side tells me I have to reduce my exposure. Not a goodbye at all, just portfolio rebalancing.
