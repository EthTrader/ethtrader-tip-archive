>this was already a thing before the post limit rule

I reckon the rule will make people more aware of duplicates since there will be lesser posts

>i dont like this way to boost ratio , like not letting other people post . it becomes a RAT RACE

I understand. The way I see it, only early birds get to fill in the quotas. That makes it a rat race. Ultimately the pros of the new rule could outweigh the cons, that's what we hope for right?
