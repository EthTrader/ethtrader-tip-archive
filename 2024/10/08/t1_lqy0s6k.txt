>I signed up thanks to a user often mentioning it ([](https://www.reddit.com/user/cryotosensei/)) and speaking greatly about it

Sensei is a nice guy. He was one of the guys who made me feel welcomed when i joined a month before T2V went live. Others, including those i never interacted with were blocking me for no reason at the time. ðŸ˜‚ 

Got to know about the sub and r/cc from reddit RSS feeds to an app I use called Feedly. What the app basically does is feed crypto content from reddit. The feeds were encouraging, I remember one guy from Egypt made a post about how Donut changed his life and I decided to join months after. The sub has good vibes. Been to r/cc and made a few post but the folks there are too uptight for my liking.
