first: why this is flaired as a self story? it clearly isn't!


second: I agree on all the line OP, but I feel our words are useless at this point.

the way this sub is being modded and managed is so bad that I don't think it can never be fixed.

and the worst part is that it become a place where concerns are censored and other mods aren't even showing up to end this shitshow

but they can't fool the market, $DONUT is dying 'cause people realised how worrying all this is
