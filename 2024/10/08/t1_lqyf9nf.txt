Completely agree, this is terrible. I'm just catching up on the drama and the lack of accountability is insane. Mistake after mistake and it's arguments and passive aggressive instead of solutions, the sub has changed SO much in such a short time, makes you wonder why or what the actual motivations are.   
  
Selectively removing comments, denying it's happening, targeting certain people, letting others slide, taking a day off to hope it cools down, claiming it's all bots.. It's a shambles, we're like a pack of little children and it's embarrassing. We're supposed to be representing Ethereum here and we've failed.
