But of course, if the mods don't want it, it won't be accepted. I think we've gone too far with these rules! People already start posting at 6.00 because it's pointless later (since they won't get the tips before the 50th comment), or you just can't post anything because of the restrictions. Also those who log in later in the day are very damaged as most users passed 50 comments before noon. I try not to go over the limit until my 3rd post because I want to give weight to everyone with my tip. I see there are other users doing it and I think , that this is the right way.
