Thanks man yeah, I thought about selling all mine as well as they only go down and I don't agree with the direction it's headed or the decisions being made but it's only 20k Donuts so if they manage to pump it I'm treating it like a moonshot earned for 0 dollars 0 cents.

It's literally crashing, down to 0.4 now.
