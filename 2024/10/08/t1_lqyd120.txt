I understand that the desire to clear this sub of incorrect users, spam and inappropriate topics was universal and supported by everyone. But with each new imposed rule, we get stuck more and more. It was clear from the very beginning that with the new rules, the attraction of new users will become more and more more difficult. I have raised the alarm many times about this, and not only me. With each subsequent rule it becomes more and more difficult for old users, and what remains for new ones, or for those who want to join. After all, this is a community and it should decides together what is appropriate and correct and what is not. These individual decisions of the mods look like a dictatorship, because we do not have the right to vote. I do not know what the purpose is and what is meant when it is said that we are developing and now it is better. The facts say that we are getting bogged down and soon this will turn into a sub of mods and 20 users. Absolute centralization, and we all know what happens with such projects.
