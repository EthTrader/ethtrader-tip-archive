I sadly of to sort of agree with you here. I don't think the entire moderation team has a hand in it though. Maybe some are busy and not involved enough at the point sadly.

I also found it utterly unprofessional to read the way you got accused of brigading and using bots and alts to downvote while genuine users read the way moderation was handled and thought to themselves "that's not right". One should be able to express his opinion without being accused by a member of the moderation team in such a manner. The accusations were also totally unfounded as we could see by the big amount of known users who showed support for you. !tip 1
