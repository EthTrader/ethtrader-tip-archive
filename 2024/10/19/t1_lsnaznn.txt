Always bullish on ETH but I believe that we can go down again now. I dont see BTC strong enough to breah the downtrend line and eth to break the triangle pattern. Anyway, bull run after US elections. then dump. Then pump around fed 2025, dump again and then ATH on May. (similar to 2021). Then big dump again and new ATH in October 2025
