That's not what influencer means. The definition of influencer in this context is someone that is paid to promote items or services on social media. 


Vitalik does not get paid, eth is not an item or service and he's not on IG taking pouty ass photos near the ethereum or peddling a sectet sneaky link. 


He does 'influence' of course and he is an influential person but that verb is not the intended meaning or usage here. Another little bit of silliness.
