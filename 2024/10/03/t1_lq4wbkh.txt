What I meant to say: You can delete any comments and they will not count towards the cap, so in the end u can have 50 tipped comments per day. But that would require a lot of effort and manovering. But it is possible. 

Hope this was your question?

”Tip 1” do not count because, as you said, they dissapear! So feel free to tip people as u wish!
