I would be totally devestated if Eth didn't make even 80% of the all time high in the bull run next year.Â 


Each cycle ran 720 days roughly, putting the next run at october 2025. Do we honestly think Ethereum won't reach 4k again in over a full year? When it was at 4k in May this year? Why do we hold any?!
