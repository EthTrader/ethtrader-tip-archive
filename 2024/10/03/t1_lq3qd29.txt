we are still waiting for round #141 distribution to happen, but mods communicated it will take a few days cause there were no donuts on the distribution wallet and they had to manage a few things before to make the distro happening 

I think new fresh baked donuts will arrive into our wallets in a couple of days 🤞🏻😁

happy to help, bronut 💪🏻🍩
