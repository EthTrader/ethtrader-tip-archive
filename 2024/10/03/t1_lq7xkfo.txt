A good post can take anywhere between 30mins up to an hour to write out - whereas a link takes up to 3 minutes to find and check for ai, and duplicate.

I'll typically see 8-14 tips on a link post, and 4-8 tips on original content... most people just respond to the clickbaity headline of a news article.

Barely anyone actually engages with discussion over a text post.

But. I shall persist.
