donuts have been recently migrated on Arbitrum One, and you can buy them ok sushiswap, but I'm pretty sure you can also still buy them on gnosis or mainnet 

if you are used to play with defi it should be pretty straightforward, otherwise try to have a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bx8c4n/how_to_buy_donuts_in_easy_few_steps/)

is 6 months old but if you use metamask is still useful 😁
