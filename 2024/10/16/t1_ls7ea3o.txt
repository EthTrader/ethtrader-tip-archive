A whale on mainnet funded the wallet from the Paxos exchange 37 days ago and bought the 1.3m donuts with almost 4 eth.  They sold the same today at 2am UK time for a big loss. The wallet has not earned any contrib here in the sub, but they are probably not european and wanted to remain anonymous.

Of the Donuts sold, their 1.3m is only a part of a wider sale of another 1.3m spread over 4 wallets in the past few days, none of which are members in the sub.
