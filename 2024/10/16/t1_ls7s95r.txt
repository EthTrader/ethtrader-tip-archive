well, a lot happened...

Airline presented the new topic limiter that has been introduced with a donut initiative, not through a proposal. Many of all didn't take it well, and got went hot in that specific post.

After that a mod sold 500k donut and another investor and active user sell to protect their investment.

then mods went missing saying they are working on something important...

I don't know, something doesn't feel right to me
