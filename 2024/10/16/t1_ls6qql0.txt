Reddit upvotes would lure so many people again. New users feel disadvantaged somehow. T2V is not bad but cost us 2/3, a hand full was cheater. The rest are scared away.

If we get rid of topic limiter and AI rule (often not accurate and mods use premium version) which often have other results than the free version. I just find that out by coincidence
