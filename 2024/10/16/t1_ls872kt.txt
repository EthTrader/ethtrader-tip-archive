I'll consider what you said but I'm still not sure if I actually want to go through the effort of learning all the rules, already been here a year and haven't earned even 25% of the gov power, I did a masters degree in months less time and energy, it seems.. off, and even though this comment'll probably get removed something stinks here and I can't tell what it is yet. Patiently waiting.
