Had some stables to spare and took some ETH to set up some liquidity pools without ranges. If ETH goes up, I'm literally DCAing out as my ETH is slowly converted into USDC. If ETH goes down, my USDC is slowly converted into ETH till I've had DCAed in enough haha. I also keep the trading fees. Doing it with memecoins is far better to generate fees, but I'm not interested in increasing my memecoin holdings. Instead, I plan either holding more ETH at lower prices or slowly selling it as it goes up, so good business for me as I have little time to watch the charts now.
