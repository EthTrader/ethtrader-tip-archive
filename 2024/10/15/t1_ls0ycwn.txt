Nice post. I think 3k is coming but I can't get a chub on after seeing it drop from 4k to 2100, yeah cool it's risen back but it's not anywhere near close to regaining any of that 50% loss in the past few months while memes and other alts absolutely soar, what's eth even gonna do like double it's ath or something? Even 10k will be like btc's 100k where it's not guaranteed and we just talk about it for years and years
