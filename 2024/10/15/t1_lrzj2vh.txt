I guess I'm inadvertently trading DONUTs by being one of the top liquidity providers xD

It's been interesting watching the trading range settle, and see where the support levels lie, not so much in USD but relative to ETH price.

It's great to see some more DONUT trading actually occur though, that's the only way we can slowly build - slowly increase our pools TVL and potentially become of interest of any other listing.
