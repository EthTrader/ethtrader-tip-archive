I think it’s a combination of things, the bear market is likely to be the biggest factor, wouldn’t be surprised.

But some people are neglicting the fact that we have lost users due to certain rules. I don’t care which or them is the bigger factor.

I just don’t want this sub to only rest on the ”but when the bull market returns there will be traffic 🚀” mindset. That’s not a proactive way to approach the sub. We should also understand that what we do with the sub also plays a role in people wanting to stay here or not. That’s how I see it anyway
