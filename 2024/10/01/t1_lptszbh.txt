> So I'll make a post about price prediction for ETH and will explain in the post what I based my prediction on

Pretty much; whatever data points / research you choose to use, whatever logic or reasoning justifies your prediiction.

Your post title can be whatever you want; eg. "Uptober is here, ETH price prediction" or "Ethereum Price Prediction, October 2024"  or "Eth Price Performance Analysis" etc.. whatever you feels best suits your post and you.

So long as it complies with all sub rules (Basically, if its removed by the mods or automod because it's too short, has traces of AI, deemed plagiarized by another source or user it won't be eligible for the contest)  - once you have submitted it; then you can share the link to your post in this thread; with [ENTRY] - so I can easily find it and document it.

Hope this clears everything up, let me know if you have any other questions.
