I've already said this before - people are downright ignoring the root cause which is that we simply don't have enough active members

We have around 30 active members in the monthly distribution that contributes regularly. Do people realise how little that actually is?

You're not going to get 'quality discussions' with that number of people. r/cc has more than 10 times the people than us, 'quality posts' are still once in a blue moon, no number of rules is going to increase the quality substantially no matter what rules you try to implement here.

You're making rules for freaking 30 people here ffs.
