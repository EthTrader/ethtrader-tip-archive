Maybe I should do some guides! xD

But, yes, like with everything, there is always some risks. Whether it's smart contract exploits, exchanges going bust, signing malicious contracts etc...

Even then, you never have to stake ALL your ETH either... and, Coinbase is probably the exchange I would trust most, given they are backed by insitutions.

But, only do what you feel comfortable with as well! No point getting stressed or worried about investments
