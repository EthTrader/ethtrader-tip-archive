So I'll make a post about price prediction for ETH and will explain in the post what I based my prediction on and then post the post title in this thread with the tag \[Entry\] added. Do I need to tag my post also? Do I need to share link here?

Did I get this right?

This is basically a contest that encourages users to post text posts? That's fucking amazing idea. Thanks!
