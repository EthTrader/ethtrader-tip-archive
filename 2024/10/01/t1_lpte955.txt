Unfortunately, thats also the state of crypto right now. The sub is still consistently floating in the top10 for crypto subs on Reddit. It's not like other subs are gaining hundreds of new users and we are not.  All those avatar subs are simply given a "in the top 100" ranking.

We're probably going to have to wait for market sentiments to really change, and new users come to Reddit to learn about this "crypto thing" as they did back in 2021.
