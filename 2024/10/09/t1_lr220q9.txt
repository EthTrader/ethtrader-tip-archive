>RCPs projects like BRICKs and MOONs have had the same downtrend. This is clearly happening because the market manipulators that where buying/selling coins through DONUT, BRICK and MOON are sleeping now and those market manipulators will eventually come back because who doesn't love making easy money?

Agreed with you on this. Bricks sometimes sees a significant pump outta nowhere, it's not as if bricks has anything good going with it and even the community doesn't give a fvck anymore.

It's just whale manipulating the price of RCPS and will eventually comes back and do it again. I believe all RCPs are still gonna pump again, the manipulators are still gonna be back
