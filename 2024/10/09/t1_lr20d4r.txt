Lmao why are people downvoting this comment. It's not like Airline hasn't done anything positive to the sub or donuts itself. He's the reason why donut 🍩 is on DEX and hosted lots AMAs which the recent ones was with POLYGON.

Let just be positive please... We should leave every negative things we have behind and push for a better proposals. The market is already fvcking us real hard, let Bronuts not fvck eachother
