I know.

But is just isn't fun to look at 15 SHIB posts and 23 ethereum price prediction everyday.

Like it's a obvious that people make those kinda of posts to just farm regardless the quality of the content.

Maybe people is mad just because they will not spam useless news to just farm anymore.

We can work in improving the new system, but again imo it's not too bad.
