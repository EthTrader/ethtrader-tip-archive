Tbh I don't think TIP2VOTE is the problem. TIP2VOTE to receive donut isn't a bad idea and that has helped with the downvotes system.

Remember during the reddit upvotes, they're so many people banning eachother and accusing eachother for vote manipulation etc.

I think we're good with the TIP2VOTE.

For more users to come in, we needs to approve post articles that mentioned other layer1 coins. Comparison between Solana and Eth will introduce Solana folks. Comparison between bitcoin and Eth will introduce bitcoin folks. 

The rule I think is best so far is the 3hours cool down & the TIP2VOTE. 

We just needs to talk about other tokens in articles and even in daily. Let people also be able to express themselves in daily
