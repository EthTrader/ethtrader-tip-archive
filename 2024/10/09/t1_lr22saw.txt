I've had long chats with Airline quite often, even before he became a marketing manager or mod. From my personal interactions with him, I can say that I found him to be more than reasonable. He can be a bit annoying sometimes, but he has nothing but good intentions for the sub and Donuts.

Maybe we (users) don't have to always agree with mods and can always find a common ground to resolve things. We're hardly now max 20-30 active users, don't wanna make it even worse.
