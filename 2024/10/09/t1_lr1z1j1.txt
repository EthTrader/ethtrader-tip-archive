Just curious, what caused this unilateral implementation by the mods?

Iâ€™ve been here just over a year and this is the first time a change like that has been implemented with the community having zero input whatsoever. 

I agree the vibes on the sub was much better at the end of last year before all these changes came into place. Little rules, everyone was commenting how different it was to the over moderation at r/cc - imo the only real change we needed to make was the tip to vote to remove the cheaters and that was it
