Not a stop loss to be honest, but I'm always checking price action to see how strong is the volume behind the movements I'm tracking. If I feel things don't look good and there is a chance price drops further, as long as there is a good support below, why not selling? 

As for holding, I would just cut my losses if I realized my money could be better employed somewhere else, also considering the reward ratio is higher on the other end
