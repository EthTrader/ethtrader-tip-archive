I don't know... it think downvotes, as much as upvotes, should send a message, that we all should at least consider

And wen a comment gets 10 upvotes or 10 downvotes in a community with 50 active users, that message should be listened even more

I hate than in here everytime a comment get downvotes people blame alts, brigading or bot.

Reddit is where it is cause this systems of upv/dwv at its core is so powerful and democratic, in both the direction
