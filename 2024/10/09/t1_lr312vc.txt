Funny thing is, almost all of my proposals have actually had no bearing on the rules of the sub. Except for one about posting old/out of date information, my proposals have all been about increasing CONTRIB, increasing voting incentives, balancing multipliers and increasing liquidity incentives - none of which have any change in moderation of the sub.
