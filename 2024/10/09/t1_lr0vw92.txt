I'm a Binance user but not too willing to buy bnb now. Hoping that I get something out of my 1.6k marks + 15ish badges even though I'm pretty certain that it'll be fully linear and that I might be looking at 10 cents per mark. 

Have you taken a look at Avantis? Doesn't look to bad and we would be early there by depositing some USDC.
