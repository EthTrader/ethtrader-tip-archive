>  there are a huge number of factors at play, that could be affecting activity/growth

Plenty of other crypto subs are reporting the same thing, those with community tokens, and those without. Market sentiment is still a huge factor to the "lack of new users" - and the majority of active people now are those who have simply been in the space a long time and have strong conviction, those who are too balls deep in crypto and still not "out of the woods" from the 2022 bear market.. and those who are aware of community tokens to farm them.

New users aren't coming here because of the rules, new users arn't coming to crypto subs in general.

HamsterKombat rose up to the 6th ranked crypto sub in the days after it's airdrop, and then it disappeared again.
