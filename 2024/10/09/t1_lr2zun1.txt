You have my vote. I wanted to do a post like Buzzalu to clarify what would be the best to come back to the time around March 2024 when we had the biggest traffic. Reddit upvotes, 3 posts 24h, 3 hour cooldown, 50 comments cap, delete double posts, no AI rule, no topic limiter.. Maybe I fogort something, but something like this would bring us to a healthy growing sub again for sure.

+ dynamic reward Donut cap like RCC is using it. Cap the max. Donuts to earn every month.
