I actually donâ€™t agree with the moderation and how the recent episode was handled

At the same it it shouldnâ€™t take away good things that has been done for the community. Amidst all the heat this one mod has been taking, donâ€™t think he should be seen as an â€˜enemyâ€™ or anything like that since we all want the best for the community and he has done more than his fair share

One thing tho maybe the word â€˜Friendlyâ€™ should be removed from the username as Iâ€™ve not seen another get into so many individual confrontations with community members before.. ðŸ˜‚
