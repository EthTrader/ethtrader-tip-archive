A quick summary is a great way to start the daily!

Unfortunately, my consistency is likely to drop off now; day light savings has come into affect, so Aussie time zone is now even further in the future - and the daily is posted even later in the day for me. Plus, we head towards summer my sporting and beach commitments increase as well! 🏄

But, I'll try my best to continue to daily opener where possiible.
