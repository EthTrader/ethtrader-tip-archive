My crazy suggestion would be a 3 part proposal..

With the comment limits, and the posting restrictions, there is less need to rely on tip2vote for fair distribution.

However, posting is still worth too much relative to comments, which is why tip2vote was especially required.

Therefore, I would also suggest combining to Post and Comment rewards into  a single allocation, this means there is just 1 ratio for all.

This will reduce the significance of post vote manipulation as we saw it.
