>What do you think will happen moving forward? what's your feelings and expectations?

I'm expecting the price to pump about next year.



>How much has this sub changed since you got here in the first place?

The sub has changed alot since I joined, I joined a few months before T2V, the daily was filled with alot spam but it I gotta admit that it was kind of fun lol. 

One thing that made me love T2V was the downvoting and cheating.
