It's because you can get a buzz out of feeling like you can change something, or a buzz out of feeling like your intelligent ideas are valuable and make the sub better. It's alluring to the type of person who has absolutely 0 power, control or influence in their real lives and has never been in and will never be a position of real authority or worth to society at large.

Translation for the younger folk: Ain't got no rizz, will never influence anything, fax on god. The vibes become low key depressive when they realize they can't ever be alpha, it's giving skibidi desperation but got the blinkers on, channeling energy into social media instead of a career and trying to have sex or any of the things that make you actually happy.
