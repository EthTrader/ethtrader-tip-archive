I'm annoyed about the fact that so many posts are links. They literally link people OUT of the community. They are low effort farming contributions that posters sometimes barely even read themselves.

I'd require every poster wishing to share a link to an article outside of Reddit to write at least as much as coinfeeds-bot about his or her own thoughts on the article.

This would:

* reduce farming
* demand critical thinking before posting
* encourage debate
* keep people in Reddit vs. direct them elsewhere
