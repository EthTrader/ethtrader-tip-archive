When we had much fewer rules, we had a stable price of $0.03 and 3-4x as many users.

Since t2v + more rules that make posting difficulter, many changed the sub.

We are limited to ETH, its L2s and ERC20 token..

Feels like we have a new rule and must find another to solve the problem from the rule before..

This is scaring people away. We lost a lot of members and just a handful was cheaters.

Top earners are still top earners, with the same names. Nothing changed.

But what changed is the activity!

Donut could be RCC token Nr. 1 but many rules are stopping us from growth. 

People enjoy from hard work and post and chat with other users thatÂ´s it.
