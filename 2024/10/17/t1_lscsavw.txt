We lost 2/3 due tv2, and many after AI rule. My activity is very less now due annoying topic limiter. People want to chill and live free. Just us 15 members are "okay" with this. We are not growing. That´s the result.

People search other subs where they can post like they want. We will always stay in our little cosmos if we don´t go back to 2023.
