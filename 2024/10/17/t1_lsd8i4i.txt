Thank you bro! Life is awesome at the moment, unlike the price of Donuts or Ethereum, which are both massively down since I last checked, with Eth rebounding nicely Donut looks like it can freefall at any time.  

Congrats on the health kick, always inspiration to hear about people taking control of their fitness and their lives! Consistency is the key, even small changes add up over time. Much like Ethereum, you dollar cost average once a month and before long you've got a real stack built up, or in fitness you work out a few times a week and in 6 months you can make some real lasting changes. Go and get it!!
