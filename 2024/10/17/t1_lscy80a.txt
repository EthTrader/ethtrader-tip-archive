>You cool? Life treating you wonderfully I hope?

quite the opposite on the weight side xD got an injury and stopped running 5 months ago, still recovering but I have to admit it hasn't been easy considering running was taking 25h per week and it was bringing most of my mental health 🫠

But I'll recover, I know that, just need to be extra patient 💪🏻

have great days ahead mate 😁

>I was totally correct about everything I thought and said

yeah, I hear you 🫠 situation is even more worrying than I thought tho
