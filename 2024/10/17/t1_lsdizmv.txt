I've been away for a little while, each time I do this I come back and it's slightly worse than before. T2V cut the activity by half, and saying the people that left were all cheaters is bananas. The spam and farming by the same users is the same, alt accounts have clearly not stopped. There are no new users. The rules and dedication it takes to learn seem punitive and the people that do post are having every other post removed. I see that many comments are being removed, when we used to have anti censorship ethos now we do not and nobody voted on these changes. New changes are implemented now without a vote of any kind, the votes that we do have have made the place worse.

The price speaks for itself, the lower number of active users and the discontent speaks for itself, no amount of censorship is gonna hide it and they can't stop us all because there'll be 4 people with 2 accounts each left arguing with each other's echoes.
