Every rules we make, we always thinking of bringing another to perfect the previous rules. Why can't we just leave things as it is currently. Let grow with what we have. If we need new members, let them come in with the current rules and adapt with it.

If we keep changing and changing every rounds, it'll even be more complicated.

RCC rules has never been complicated even though they make proposal in the META sub. If we want to go with TIP2VOTE, let go with it. And even the TIP2VOTE has helped against people that game the system and downvotes too

I'm against the cap too bcos we all say new members are finding it hard to earn donut. If we introduce donut cap per distro, they'll be alts and people will even find it hard to tip new comers as they will feel reluctant to waste their donut on people that don't have the 1tip weight and if we're to introduce cap, how will the new comers who want to be part of the community get the time to reach a 20k governance power?

But I really don't mind. Any proposals that passes, I go with it
