Looks like they added a new rule. Happened to me yesterday, i complained and nothing happened. I had to forfeit my third post and got my posting time reset. I won't be able to post until 3 hrs time. 
You won't pay for pay2post fee, but you will forfeit the post. This is contrary to what they said in their donut ~~autocratic~~ initiative rule. 
Sky was right all along....
