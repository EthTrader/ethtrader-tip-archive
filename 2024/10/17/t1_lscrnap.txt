I agree with everything you said but with Reddit upvotes rules, that I disagree. We all know how so many users block on eachother during those time thinking they're shitnuts. Every new users was targeted as alts. I don't really see any problems with the current rules tbh.

The post limiter was good. The AI rules, we're adapting to it already. The TIP2VOTE doesn't have any problems with it. The only thing we need is new users and donuts should be known to people outside the sub. 

No matter how we change the rules, it won't invite new users unless we market it ourselves which AIRLINES have been doing for months. My suggestion is to just leave it as it is, let the marketer do what they're good at and any new comers that get into the sub, will under how things work overtime. 

But making a proposal isn't my thing.... So any direction the sub went, I'm good with it
