> The existence of the dark pool has been seen since the 1980s but in the cryptocurrency market, dark pools are known as the applications that are used by institutional investors to avoid market manipulation even after the massive orders by them. 
>
> Letâ€™s simplify this: suppose an XYZ investor has 1 million shares of ABC company and he/she wishes to sell all of his/ her holdings then in a traditional trading market, he/she will either sell shares in small lots or will wait till the buyer with the same needs approaches them. 
>
> The majority of the time this practice affects the prices of any specific shares/stock resulting in losses to common shareholders. The dark pool actually serves as the decentralized application as the transaction over there can not be viewed by usual traders and the public.
