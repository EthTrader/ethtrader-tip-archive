You earn them for nothing so why would anyone buy? And for someone not earning them for free, it's quite clear that holders are just waiting for the moon, a cex listing or some pump so they can dump all they've got 

  
also there's no utility for them so no reason to buy any except as a moonshot hope and that won't happen because of the above

  
one of the main problems is that people are seeing them as some kind of shitcoin when they are actually half a governance token that does nothing without contrib, on a tiny subreddit with 50 active members and no visibility
