I didn’t say this wasn’t happening, I was just curious how they profit since  no BroNuts are actually buying. 

I only buy substantial amounts on a big dump and avoid all Pumps, when it crabs I buy $6 worth so they ain’t profiting off that lol.

Most likely they are battling each other. They are 2 members in the entire community that have 6 figures more Donuts than Contrib (Sky and myself, and Sky only bought once I think) so that’s seems to be the only way ‘exit liquidity’ can come from a heir schemes
