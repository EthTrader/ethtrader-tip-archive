My God what have I logged to. This is a cleanse. I want to believe some are innocent and were just caught in the system? You said you have even used AI to validate so it must be legit.

Still, I can't fully believe everyone of them were manipulating. Kinda sad we have come to this.

Is a perma ban the best way to deal with it? What about prolonged ban like 15 days or something?

Feels bad this happened and for those really playing the system, you pet the greed take the best out of you.
