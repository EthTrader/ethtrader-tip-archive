Those numbers are great n all but have no context. You could argue the % that has been deemed non suspicious is high

We are a small sub with hardly any active users and we adopted a system where we have to tip to upvote. So when you're having a conversation with someone rather than just the good ole Reddit upvote we now have to put !tip 1 

Most of these users are active as hell and when they are chatting to each other they !tip 1. I'm the same! I very rarely reply without !tip 1 because I'm generous and that's what I have to do if I want to upvote someone

Have you looked at what times these people are most active and looked at some examples of the tipping back and forth? 

I know manipulation was rife before T2V but just picture something for me for a minute. Let's say you could see a conversation between 2 people and all comments of their conversation are on +2. Would you not think that's normal and just 2 people upvoting each other as they talk? 

Difference here is we have to do the !tip 1. When T2V first got suggested I said I'm down to get rid of manipulation but 100% you are going to find patterns that mean nothing 

Look at every hunt. Been here for fucking ages and actually contributes to the sub unlike most of us. Look at his donut earnings over time and how long it's taken him to get the contrib he's got. You're essentially saying the dude waited until upvoting was transparent to suddenly engage in manipulation 

The analysis done here did not magically become possible over night it could have been done at any point. Why has it happened now just after the fallout with airline on his topic limiter post?

Didn't airline get banned for farming using alts Aminok? But you unbanned him and made him a mod? This is not brigading it's a genuine question because I don't know if it's true but you will
