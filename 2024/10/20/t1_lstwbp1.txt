I've been doing it with no minimum bids required and anyone can bid. Banner space is available for one week. Users have a week to submit their bids. Highest bidder wins. Although we may not always hit high numbers but at least its better than 0! You can see this process on Taco, GONE or Plunger subs that I mod on.
