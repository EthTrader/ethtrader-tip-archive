If I want to upvote you now (which I do) do I do it or not? Now there are even less people all of a sudden we may be a % of each others tips deemed to be manipulative

The irony is I'm assuming I'm not on that list because over the last few months I've grown tired of the sub and become less active. Still active but nowhere near as I used to be

I've never used manipulation anywhere on Reddit  I wouldn't take it for granted like that but it appears if you're very active you may get accused of doing something you haven't

I'm tipping this comment because I like the use of the GIF not because me and Abdeliq are in a ring together
