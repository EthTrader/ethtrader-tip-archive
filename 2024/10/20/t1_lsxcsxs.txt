Fair call - I think looking at some of the content of what was tipped should factor in as well, eg, if Hunt makes a guide, and someone asks him a bunch more questions on it is valid.

I think some users should have simply been given a warning and a reminder to reserve tips for on topic and relevant discussion rather than general hellos and weekend plans.
