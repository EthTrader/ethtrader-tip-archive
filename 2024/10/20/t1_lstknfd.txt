Their profitable trades are publically available to see, I can't remember off the top of my head their exact methods but you can go take a look. Last time they had a manual grid trade method with multiple wallets, buying bits to try and cause others to fomo in then dumping in batches later on for small profits each time.

  
my inability to articulately explain does not mean it didn't and isn't happening constantly
