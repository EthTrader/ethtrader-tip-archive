Just spectulation, but the criteria for airdrop 5 was pretty clear, which included interactions with a given number of OPstack chains, like Fraxtal, Base, Mode, etc... So possibly interacting with Unichain is likely to boost your OP superchain footprint somehow!

As for that, have no idea lmao I just write and that's it
