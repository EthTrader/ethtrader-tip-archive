Yo you can't compare conehead to here tbh. I understand what you said and I get it but bitcone is lower in price compared to donut. 

Let say you tip 50 user a donut tip, it's equal 1,400 donut per snapshot and some user tip more than 3k donut every round.... So I don't think tipping one donut is bad

And I've seen some user who has tipped me more than 1 donut. Some mods tipped me more than 1 and whenever I see better content I love, I tipped more than 1 donut too.

But people just imagine as 1 tip equal one upvotes which might be 50 donuts for post ratios. I think any tip is a fair tip tbh

>! !tip 1!<
