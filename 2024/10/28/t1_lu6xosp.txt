Dude you’re already invested and it’s already so low compared to other cryptos, if you sell now and it pumps eventually you will feel even worse.

I think the best way just HODL and stop looking at the chart or look for another coin you wanna invest in and focus all your energy on that.

Of course if you really wanna exit now I guess it’s not that bad - at least you didn’t sell below 1k

(This is not financial advice, DYOR)
