From a financial point of view the Trump trade will benefit crypto way more than the Harris trade, so I think that's what most crypto people would prefer. That being said the tariffs are going to push inflation up because so many things are made in China and for CHEAP. Holding them "accountable" may just lead to another move higher in inflation and that's what I'm worried about because higher inflation means fewer rate cuts from the Fed and then downward pressure on crypto again. !tip 1
