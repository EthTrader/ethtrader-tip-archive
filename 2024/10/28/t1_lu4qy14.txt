From my personal assessment of the person that is Donald Trump, his effect as President of the US is net negative and potentially catastrophic and undeniably stupid and embarrassing.

I'm a simple Aussie and we've had some serious shit shows of a prime minister over the years. But Trump takes the cake for being most obviously a very bad candidate for presidency.

There are numerous examples, basically any search for anything Trump has said or done could find you something that should disgust you enough to not want that person in a place of phenomenal power.
