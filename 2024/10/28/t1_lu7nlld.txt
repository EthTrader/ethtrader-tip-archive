BTC dominance is still on the rise, currently at 59.85% which is the highest level since around March 2021. In 2021 BTC dominance peaked just above 73%, so this BTC outperformance could still have legs to run. Only when a clear reversal in BTC dominance happens WHILE BTC PRICE IS STILL GOING UP then altseason really begins, because that means alts are starting to go up faster than BTC
