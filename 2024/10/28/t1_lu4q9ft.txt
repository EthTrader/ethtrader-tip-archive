I honestly would probably leave if this passed. I don't even spend that much time in the daily anymore but not everyone is making 50 comments a day anyway so the comment count "advantage" is negligible. Taking away karma from the daily is ridiculous in my opinion. It breathes life into this community of news links. Give the daily a 0.05x multiplier to donuts rewards after the 50 comment cap and call it a day (pun intended). The daily has suffered enough.
