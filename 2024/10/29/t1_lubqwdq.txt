Vitalik is the most important figure in the Ethereum community and we should show some respect by not putting him in the influencer category. When I hear the word influencer I think of the people who do clickbait things on Youtube/Tiktok for views and do not contribute much to society whereas Vitalik constantly tries to improve the biggest DeFi ecosystem in the world and definitely contributes to making the crypto sector a better place.

To have only 2 slots where Vitalik has to share with other "influencers" and "celebrities" feels like we are censoring something from the most important co-founder of Ethereum. 

This is the kind of governance poll proposal I have been waiting for and I hope it passes.
