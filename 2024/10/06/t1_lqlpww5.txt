I've been complaining that much, that people doesn't even listen to me anymore, and I know I can be annoying....

but the complaining I'm seeing in the past days in here, from so many different people, reinforce my belief that this sub has become ridiculous.

and the scary part is that many users complaining, and get a lot of upvotes, and yes mods ignore them, infact they often delete their submissions ðŸ« 

I agree with you legend, so much.
