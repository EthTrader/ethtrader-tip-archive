Its obvious they want to stop donut farming thru posts, but if that is their main agenda, just nuke the links to 0.25 and not implement 10000 ruled around posting. Its getting ridiculous man. 

Im not gonna get into story where many people were fine when they were farming Donuts when ratios was god knows how high but not suddenly they want changes when they got like 200k or 300k+ donuts. Pretty sus behavior tbh
