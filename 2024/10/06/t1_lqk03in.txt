Hi Marc

The transition from MATIC to POL seemed to go pretty smoothly from a user-experience end. Did everything go to plan behind the scenes or were there some unexpected obstacles that had to be overcome that you can talk about?

Polymarkets has been a huge dapp for Polygon in terms of use and volume - are there any other dapps built on Polygon you believe will "explode" in 2025?

While it might not be the best metric to use, it is a metric - according to l2beats, the market share of Rollups is heavily dominated by ARB and BASE in particular, all Optimistic Rollups - How long do you think until ZK's start to really grow in and catch up or even flip the competition?
