I think there's a lot of potential with the games coming out and on Shibarium.  And I'm interested to see where that goes.  I think gaming and crypto is a market that needs to become a real thing.  Like GTA 6 for example.  Could you imagine running business or selling real estate, or whatever in game and making real coin?  I like the idea.
