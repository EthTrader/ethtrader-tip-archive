yes, you can make money out of anything with luck or good trading skills (look at the bricks Reddit token), but what happened there was a shitshow and my gutt tells me some big mod wallet there, is going to dump hard as soon as the price is decent enough.

I believe when a project dies, it dies forever.... when this doesn't happen, is often because who manages it wants to make money out of it

hope I am wrong of course ðŸ™ƒ
