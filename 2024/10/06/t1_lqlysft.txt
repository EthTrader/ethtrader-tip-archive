A mod deleted my post [https://new.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1fwu25g/mantle\_mnt\_price\_prediction\_2024\_2025\_20262030/](https://new.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1fwu25g/mantle_mnt_price_prediction_2024_2025_20262030/) and says it´s 76% AI. I and Fredzoor proofed for 54% AI.

Maybe one more can proof that it´s not over 75% ?

I´m angry because I read that this mistake happened to a few more bronuts the last days.

I'm starting to think that these aren't coincidences anymore.

I feel like this is happening on purpose.
