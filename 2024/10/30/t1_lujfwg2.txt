So kinda yes and no. This has less to do with the general ease in deploying tokens via 1-Click token deployers. The RCC explosion happened after Coneheads adjusted their code for easy deployment across other subs. Some RCCs did still try to make their own RCC code base or adjusted the Coneheads Code base. But after Coneheads became easy to mass deploy we see a bunch of them get deployed every month.
