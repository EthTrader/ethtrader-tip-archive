The thing that people donâ€™t realize is that REAL INTEREST RATE matters, i.e the rate of interest after deducting inflation.

ETH inflation for 2024 is around 0.20% (coinmarketcap data) but the yield is 2.70% (binance), so real interest rate is positive because yield is higher than inflation

Meanwhile DOT inflation in 2024 is 19.7% (coinmarketcap data) but the yield is 10% (binance), so real interest rate is negative because yield is lower than inflation
