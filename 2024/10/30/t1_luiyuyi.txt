Until proven otherwise, I believe 2025, will continue to cycle of post-bitcoin halving, but also once the election has settled, whoever wins, the general economy will atleast stabilize, while the next president will be there for the next 4 years.

But, we shall wait and see! Obviiously war and the rest of the world could change things pretty quickly too.
