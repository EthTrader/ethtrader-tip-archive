I looked at the Saturday daily and it's like 80% complaining.. like, damn, it's the weekend, chill! 

Tell you what drives users away more then a few easy to follow rules, is constant whinging - genuine users will leave while the ones that stay and continue to complain are those wanting their $100 a month "paycheck".

Good luck the mod team, that's all I can say.
