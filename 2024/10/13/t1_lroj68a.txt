Thanks i guess i do not qualify anyway since i never used it, but will register regardless. 

How do you know when an airdrop happened? Since i am not active on Twitter i guess i would miss when the air drop happens. If i just find some random coins in my metamask, i guess i would need to check actively, i would not trust does coins anyway...

Eg i also do the bera thing you posted, how would i know the airdrop happens?
