This is making mods feel unmotivated, 

Jake rarely comments in here after some drama with some users here

Ray told me that he prefers to stay quiet these days. probably he's often accused of nuking favouritism. It's easy to see that every one of his comments are heavily downvoted. ğŸ’€

I still think Airlines drama could've been avoided if users voted for the limiter( it would pass, I'm sure.)
