There's never a clear reason why people decide in their minds to buy or sell a certain asset, I understand the point of your question but from experience you never ever find out any of the answers or insights into why people did or didn't choose to buy or sell anything. We just sort of move along, never think about it again then concentrate on whatever the next problem is.
