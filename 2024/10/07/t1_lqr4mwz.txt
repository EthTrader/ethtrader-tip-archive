I use USDC/ETH LP's to trade in and out - but I first started learning it all via r/cc moons.

All the more reason why I want to see EthTrader as a community mature from a spam sub, into a sub where people can learn a bit more to better improve their life... give a man to fish, eat for a day, teach a man to fish, eat for a life time... xD
