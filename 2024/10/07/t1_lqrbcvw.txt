> But: The issue is that 3 people analyze a link and have like 76%, 54% and 48% and this canÂ´t be normal

No, the issue is what people are actually analyzing.

As I explained previously, with your article, I saw 48% when I copy/pasted the entire page. But once I omitted all the image captions (source, trading view . com) and the table contents, I saw 76%

Copy the article body text only, and you'll have your answers.
