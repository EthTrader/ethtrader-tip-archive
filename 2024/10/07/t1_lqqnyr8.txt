Am I one of the few who actually supports T2V?

I mean I certainly don't miss the days when I get 7 straight downvotes on a post, and my Donut earnings has increased significantly from the same amount of activity presumably also because some ShitNuts were nuked.

Imo that's one change that was actually beneficial, those cheaters were really getting on my nerves and nothing is more satisfying than nuking their power
