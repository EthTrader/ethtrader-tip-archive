I would delete this rule. Its unaccurate. Its unneccesary tbh. The other side will say, it would increase link spamming, that could be true but i say just nerf the link multiplier if you are afraid and dont have 1000 rules around posting. I still dont understand why are they implementing so many rules to prevent link spamming when they can just nerf link multiplier to the ground.
