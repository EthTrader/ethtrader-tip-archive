I know, this is just Reddit, and I should learn to let it be and don't give a fuck too...

anyway, you have no idea how much I appreciate your message Goldy, I don't hide that sometimes I get carried away and I feel like maybe I see things wrongly, but God this brigading thing makes me wanna puke...

so knowing that I'm not imagining things, it's great help!

PS: I'm not in that discord, but people send me screenshot all the time, and I agree... it's pure hypocrisy ðŸ™ƒ

but, end of the day, I am an annoying and complaining farmer, and on the other side there are mods... so guess who will be gone for good sooner or later? ðŸ˜‚
