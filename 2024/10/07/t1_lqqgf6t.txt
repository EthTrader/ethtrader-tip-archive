> Since then, the number of users eligible for Donut rewards has remained constant, with no major changes.

But, I keep hearing the narrative that the sub is dead and it's not fun to be here anymore. As stated by all the people who still continue to be here and return every single day... xD

IMO - What's next is to continue developments and social networking, and continue to improve the product that is DONUT. By reducing the spam-fest that EthTrader has become, by promoting more organic and natural discussion. Yes, there will be noise, there will be resistance - people are used to just enjoying casual conversation and off-topic content to earn a few dollars.

Through rule changes and moderation changes we can create long term and big picture improvements which will grow the worth of EthTrader and it's DONUT token, which will make the place more appealing for advertisers to pay for exposure and media presence etc.
