Rik is the most attacked member for sure. Labeled as farmer by the farmers lol. By the same people who were farming donuts years ago when ratios were god knows how much high. People dont like him cause he have the balls to say his own opinion. There are times when i dont agree with his views (rare thing) but that doesnt mean i dont respect him, the opposite, i fully do, and he knows that. 

Maybe if we had more people with freedom to say their own thing, it would be better.
