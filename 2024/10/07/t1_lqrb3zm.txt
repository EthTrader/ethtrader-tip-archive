I could suggest nerf links to 0.5x and delete AI rule for links (not for text posts)

But: The issue is that 3 people analyze a link and have like 76%, 54% and 48% and this can´t be normal. Many say this. Feels like ZeroGPT is rolling a dice... It´s not like 78/76/74%, there are always big differences.
