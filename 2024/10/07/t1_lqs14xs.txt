Not at all. I think people are in favor of using AI for the right things in the right way. Those article writers copy the original content and then paste a prompt to "hatGPT telling "Rewrite this to look different but say the same and add whatever, make it more bullish."

That is not the right way of using AI from my point of view. The same way that using AI to get people naked in pictures is the bad way.

If we as individuals dont do anything and the rest copy our way or thinking. We are doomed.
