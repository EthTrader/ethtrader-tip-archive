It's easier to be destructive then constructive. Some people see all these changes as a barrier to their $20 of crypto a month and complain the sub is dying etc.

But then people ignore posts and comments from actual paying customers and unregistered users, and then complain the mods arn't doing a good job - but hey, they all still return every single day!  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

But all these changes are for a bigger picture to improve the overall worth of the token as a serviceable product.
