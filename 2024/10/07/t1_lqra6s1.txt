If you're only looking to remove the AI tolerance on it's own, I'd certainly continue to vote against.

However, I would consider allowing AI generated articles if links then incurred further multiplier reduction, somewhere in the 0.3x to 0.4x range. 

Still more favorably weighted over Comedy and Media, but enough of a penalty to discourage the really low quality links.
