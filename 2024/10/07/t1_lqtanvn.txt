It's a terrible change and we should've had voted on this imo. Yet another limitation (2 is also super low on some topics) for our handful of users. And it's so clearly visible that most of us (active users) are pretty much against it. And on top of that complaining in the daily isn't okay anymore and should be directed to a separate thread where nobody reads our complaints. !tip 1
