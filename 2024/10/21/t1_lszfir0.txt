I hope/trust more than just tip data was used to reach the decision, as there is a difference if a user posts an airdrop guide (such as Every_hunt) and another user has several questions to ask regarding it - tipping back and forth in that sort of discussion is very different to the many tips we saw which migrated to off-topic weekend discussions and general greeting.
