I guess your are right, but the data presented in detail in the original post, looks questionable to me. I analyzed the same raw data they used directly from the bot.
For me it looks like the tool they use is flawed in terms making an indefinite decision on it.
So if there is no hard proof the posted mod data does not look daming enough to me.
There are assumptions in the detection tool which gives hints but no valid proof i guess. The community is to small so such users can look like groups without beeing a organized group.
