Generally.

I have used ETH/USDC liquidity pools as a means of trading as well, weeks like this are great, as you absorb trading fees, and then when there is a dip or "crash" and your position becomes all 100% ETH 0% stable - you exit the position, turning that imperma loss into realized loss... but then that "loss" becomes profit when/if ETH recovers. Basically it's like DCAing into ETH, but getting some additional fees along the way.

The DONUT pool on the otherhand, not so great. xD
