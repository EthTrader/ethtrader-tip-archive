Look at row 2 & 3 these users spend 6-7%  of their tips on one user the most. Row 3 the most tipped user is not even on the list. So the circle could spend at most 6% on each member, which can also happen if people are active a lot.

You in round 140 spend 12% of all you tips on lordciders, double than some persons on that list.
So you should have been flagged, from a data point of view since yours looks bad compared eg major-removes...
