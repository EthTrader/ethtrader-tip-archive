I remember when a memecoin community (shiba?) sent more than $1 Billion worth of tokens into his wallet address a few years ago during covid and he gave away all of them to a covid fund in India (there was a covid emergency in India at that time). At that moment I realized that Vitalik indeed doesn't care about money lol.
