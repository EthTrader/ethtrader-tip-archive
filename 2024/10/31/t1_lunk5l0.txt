Fault proofs eh?

*Based on an optimistic worldview, fault proofs operate on the assumption that Layer 2 data is valid until proven otherwise during a “challenge period” that typically spans seven days. If a fault-proof is generated during this period, the flagged transactions are eliminated from the batch.*

I look forward to watching the next couple of years develop between Optmistic and ZK rollups.
