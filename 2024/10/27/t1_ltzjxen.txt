Crypto is amoral (unconcerned with the rightness or wrongness of something) and it will save us a lot of scruples to think of it that way (amoral). If you want us to discuss morals then crypto shouldn't even be a thing because - if you deeply think  about it - we are picking money from each other's pockets. How is that okay?
