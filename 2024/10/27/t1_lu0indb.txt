Once we enter next year the President of the US will be sworn in. It feels like regardless who it is, it will just get more volatile. I'm thinking the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates but at a slower pace, while the Middle East tensions will continue, so hopefully market gets used to it and stops reacting so much
