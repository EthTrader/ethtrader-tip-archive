Put topic limiter on hold sound like MUSIC TO MY EARS

Imo maybe you should have just stuck to just 1 proposal (just removing the topic limiter) instead of making ‘2 in 1’ to have a greater chance of the poll passing. But maybe this will still pass by a landslide given how unpopular the topic thing is, we’ll see

My vote is \[YES\], thanks for making this much needed proposal - it’s the only one we need this month for me, no more proposals after this please !!
