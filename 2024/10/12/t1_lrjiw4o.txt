There's no problem with the limiter. The limiter has been improved on. I feel like we should just leave it as it is for now. No more rules in few rounds that'll complicate things.

Making two link post and one original post isn't a bad idea but even if we want to do that, the limiter should still be in effective. I love the topic limiter because I wouldn't want to see memecoins post too much in the sub. It'll be as if the sub is created to promote every memecoins out there
