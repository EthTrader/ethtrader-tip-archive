anytime Fred, there's so much more going on in this industry that makes crypto games not appealing for traditional companies at the moment, that's why I think if a decent games will ever exist, it will be from some independent developer or something 🙃

hope to be wrong tho, since my dream would be something like a GTA with real crypto robberies and token used in the games, or a FIFA game where you can build your team buying players from the market using crypto tokens 🥹

maybe our future sons and daughters 😂

also, thanks for the generous tip 😁
