Donuts have been on Mainnet for 5-6 years, and only on Arbitrum for 6-7 months or so. so there simply are a LOT more donuts on mainnet. The liquidity pool itself has a bit more TVL, but it's more the fact that these mainnet traders simply don't have donuts on Arbitrum to trade.

The only DONUTs that made it to Arbitrum were either awarded from the last several distirubtions, or were bridged across from Gnosis network.

The only way to bridge DONUT from mainnet to Arbitrum is via the official bridge, which iirc, takes 7 days to complete.
