Yeah I'm the same as you. I'm getting bored of all these proposals now. That's not me throwing shade at Sky I can see why they've made the proposal but that's how I feel

I would be up for a governance proposal on the topic limiter as we never got one in the first place though. I would vote yes now the limits are much better but everyone should get the chance to cast their vote
