If you had made this proposal a few days ago, my answer would have been a big [Yes], but right now it has changed.
My only problem with topic limiter was the way the two mods imposed it on everyone, without a proposal or seeking support from members here.

I've come to like topic limiter and it's good for front-page. The front-page is cleaner than ever and the topics are way more balanced, unlike when Shib and Neiro posts where littered all over.


My answer is [NO].
