We don‘t need to have any limit for 25 users. We are stucked in growth and every rule that makes posting harder will cause less activity. Me included, I‘m frustrated to post. Sometimes 2 LINKs get deleted due limiter. I give up then and touch grass. What do you think will new members think about being annoyed this way? They will leave.

We should have less rules and more fun.
