LOL

you know what, I have been recently discussing with my boss and some Devs about this eventuality, and beside not being our core business and not in our roadmap, the biggest deterrent is the legal one ðŸ« 

too many complications and lack of clarity to actually start seriously thinking about it.

And when I speak with big companies like Ubisoft, Electronic Arts and a few more, the millions they are already doing with the standard home console business, makes irrelevant the crypto/p2e industry ðŸ« 

so I'm not very bullish on decent games xD
