Yeah true... Saw news here about ETH Foundation holding NEIRO and I was keen to buy but didn't follow my guts. Then later on I saw NEIRO having higher percentages when some other top coin was in red(which missing out on NEIRO makes me feel bad :(

So imma not do the same mistake with shib.... It might rise or do the opposite but it's just the money I can afford losing :) >! I hope it rises though!<
