>Although Gambaryanâ€™s legal and investigatory case has been resolved to some extent, the position of Binance in Nigeria needs to be clarified. The Nigerian government is still reporting the crypto exchange for money laundering and has also been accused of tax fraud. According to these reports, it will continue charging the same regardless of ceasing proceedings against Gambaryan.

We can take this as a hint that Nigeria only fell to pressure from US and no single $ in settlement was paid by Binance right?
