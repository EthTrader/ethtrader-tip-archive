I totally agree with you and sometimes put it in the air.

I believe that r/ethtrader should allow to create text posts using X sources and not being flaired as media with some rules like Y amount of words/characters and content meaning.

I see so many times a lot of breaking news on X that I could post hours before mainstream media but I dont want it to be flaired as media so I just wait for the link and post it.

I think it could be interesting to give this a second thought because I believe it could raise content quality and reduce links.
