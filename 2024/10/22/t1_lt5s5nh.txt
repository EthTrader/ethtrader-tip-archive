I agree. Its really turning off investors when they see how many scams and exploits are happening. Im sure in next decade, this space will become much more less scary to be involved with or interact with. 

I mean you cant cleanse whole space from scams, its in human nature to find loopholes and use it in their advantage but you can lower the numbers.
