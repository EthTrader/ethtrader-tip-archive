Good job as always. Can I get my stats in the past rounds. Something similar to what was done [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1g83f94/investigation_into_tipping_manipulation_alt/?share_id=7j-5CVQ4FUKZl4V_6SckL&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) albeit accurate. Also if the past 4 weeks were to be taken into consideration (the last four Leader-board data beginning from this one) what will my stats look like? I understand this is too much work but thanks a lot.
