I've never heard of it myself - but, despite positive reviews, it smells scammy to me... 

If you're gonna "buy" mining power, you may as well just buy the cryptocurrency?

If you have hardware that is suitable for mining, you could look at Nicehash.com - theres no cost involved other than the electricity you will use.

Mining isn't very profitable unless you have free electricity for the most part.
