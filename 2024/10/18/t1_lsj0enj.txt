When it reached $0.90, Jump allegedly “embarked on a mass sell-off of the borrowed DIO tokens,” trading over 4 million DIO in transactions totaling $2 million. Partially as a result of this sell-off, the price fell to $0.53. Over the course of the next month, Jump traded over $6.9 million worth of DIO as the price declined to $0.26 per coin.
