Yep - Thats exactly why Im worried Layer 2s are taking too much from Ethereum. First there are too many now and because fees are cheaper people will choose Layer 2s - This takes volume from Ethereum and gwei drops then causing less ETH to be burned which makes ETH inflationary. Long story short its bad for the price !tip 1
