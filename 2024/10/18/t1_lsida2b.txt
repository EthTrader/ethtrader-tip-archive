It might be different if an exchange wants to list a token, or offers a partnership/grant or something.

But if a token has to pay a full fee, which comes from dumping treasury funds, then yeh, that will happen. 

Not to mention, exchanges like MEXC have performance reviews, for example, they delisted BRICK because it failed to maintain an average of 50k trading volume for a month.

So, pay for a listing, see the token dump, get delisted a couple months later because there was no trading volume? No deal xD
