thanks for sharing this!

this subject is very interesting to me... let me leave you below the "moral rule" Adriano Olivetti (Italian entrepeneur) was used to talk about 

"no manager, not even the highest in rank, should ever earn more than 10 times the minimum wage"

we just need more people like him I guess, but you're totally right, we're asking people who have the power to propose the changes to go against their interests ðŸ˜ž
