"Your smart home and car can “pay its own way” when it comes to compute power, selling excess capacity when you’re not using it and using more from others when needed. The result should be a sustainable network infrastructure that doesn’t need constant injections of capital from the original product sellers to keep working. If the cloud is, as the T-shirt says, just someone else’s computer – maybe it could be your neighbor's refrigerator?" seems like a cool idea. by the way congrats on making it to the round of 16, really sorry for modric "great man".
