I'm happy with how the sub turned out. If we think back to where we were last year, a lot has happened. At first I was also concerned about having t2v in the daily, but it was well received. But I'm still worried that we won't get much growth. For 8 days the addresses on ARB One have remained the same, at 1329 addresses. But don't hang your head. I think we will have a solution for this soon. 

Thanks to everyone, who is participating here.
