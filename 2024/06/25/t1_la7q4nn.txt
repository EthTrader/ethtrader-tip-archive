Good, everyone voted against the repayment plan. I specifically remember reading about it on Twitter, lots of people were complaining and saying they wouldn’t accept it.

And why would they? FTX wants to pay them at bear market prices, a bear market that THEY CAUSED. We’re talking about bitcoin under $20K refunds, it’s a scam. Screw FTX.
