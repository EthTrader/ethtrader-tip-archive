Thanks sir.

 I read about the idea of ​​showing the unclaimed rewards in gray for unregistered users. I think it's good and it should be implemented quickly.  There may just be a hurdle there. I think it's the case that unregistered users can't receive tips, so the upvote won't count either. Does that mean you won't have any unclaimed rewards or am I wrong?
