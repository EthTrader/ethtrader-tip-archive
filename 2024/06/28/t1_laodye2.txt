>donut has only ever gone up by mistake.

Fair call! Some people have certainly traded well on the speculation. Others bought high.

A dose of reality is certainly needed, I remember writing a "why I'm bearish on donut price" a few months ago, leading up to the migration. 

Perhaps theres too much obsession on trying to make DONUT bigger than what it is. 

End of the day, it's an inflationary token being 'freely' minted every month.

It might be time to review my previous "Bearish on DONUT post" from a few months ago xD
