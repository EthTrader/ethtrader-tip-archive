Yes a 43% drop is very worrying, obviously. theres no silver lining. 

  
the same people that say "nah its ok, we'll rebound" are the exact same relentless positivity crowd who seek to only say positive things no matter what to cheat by farming donuts. Donut to $1, arb migration will increase holders, raise visibility, increase volume, cex listing is incoming and then riches. Remember when people genuinely thought Kraken was definitely listing Donuts?

  
Look what actually happened, it's the opposite of the drivel that the spammers said would happen, we lost loads of real members and this is no different now - more hopeful platitudes and failing attemps at positive sentiment, while the market speaks and donut does nothing but slide even with these amas, developments, changes, toob finance etc. 

  
i say these things because I care deeply about crypto, Eth and it's investors. we owe a duty of care to tell the truth and to be honest with ourselves and each other. even if that truth is hard a 44% loss in short time speaks for itself.
