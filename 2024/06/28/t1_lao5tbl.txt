Turns out the Arbitrum migration was a sell the news event.

You could say that DONUT was simply overvalued at 2cents, 3 cents and 4 cents.

Plenty of other tokens dump that much following announcements, FET for example is also about -50% after it's ATH following the announcement of the ASI merger.

Not saying some of those other criticisms arn't valid. Just saying perhaps, this sort of correction was going to happen regardless.
