I’m a bit divided about this.

On one hand, it feels like it’s just an excuse to control the crypto providers. Where the funds come from, where the funds go to, who do the funds belong to, you get the idea.

22 years in jail for being an “unauthorized crypto provider” seems like a lot.

The good thing about turkey is that there’s no tax on capital gains, but at what cost though?
