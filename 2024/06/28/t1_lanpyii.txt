Cool, thanks for sharing! Surprised to see this is available for Australians too.

I use the CDC visa card personally, but I have noticed Etherfi plan on releasing a crypto visa card too. Had no idea Gnosis already had one up and running.

A shame a post like this doesn't get the same visibility or tips as the generic link posts.
