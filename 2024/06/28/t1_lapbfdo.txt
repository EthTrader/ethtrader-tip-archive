My take is, rewards should come from Donuts allocated for posts and comments. This way atleast it will encourage more users to participate. Anyhow I'm expecting the ratio to go higher after T2V, so it won't have much effect in general.  
Or it can even be partially from the distribution and partially from the treasury.

Given how Ethtrader has been evolving, i am sure we may need a good amount of treasury funds for something big in the future. Maybe a CEX listing, who knows.

Thoughts?
