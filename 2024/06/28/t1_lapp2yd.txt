[YES]

I believe that these contests is to be considered something extra. Therefore it would be harsch if the amount was axed from post and comment donuts. Im under the opinion that this is exactly what we have a treasury for, to be able to organize *extras* like these. 

Besides, if the competitions tend to be hard or have some sort of skill cap required, many users will not even be participating, so it would be unfair to have these ”pay” for the allocation.
