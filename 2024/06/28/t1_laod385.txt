Covid! During the pandemic I realized I didnt have a backup plan in case things went wrong so I started getting into crypto. I started with BTC but slowly shifted to ETH. I made a plan to buy $10 of ETH every single day after breakfast. And so I did. I am now in profit but will keep doing it until 4000-4500. After that I will either stop and just hold or DCA out it would depend really I never thought about the exit !tip 1
