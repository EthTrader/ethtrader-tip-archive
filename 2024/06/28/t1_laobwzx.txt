I kind of agree, but the person a few days ago selling 1.5m Donuts can't have been because of the migration. the selling has been this week, 3 months after the arb move so it can't be sell the news situation as there is never such a huge gap between event and sell off and nothing much happened this week to signal the sell off. people dont wait that long theyd have sold on the day not now. and a sell the news event doesn't stop people making really any buys for months either.

  
also the only reason donut went up before was firstly because of the rumour kraken might list donut after they got paid to list Moons, again when defimama came and got shut out with all those arguments, then again with the Reddit IPO when those miscreants on X said that buying RCPs were 'adjacent' exposures to the IPO and they were wrong too. I think even years ago when Donut went up to 9c it was only because of a rumour that reddit were gonna use Donut as the rcp, but in the end went with moons and withdrew all support.

  
donut has only ever gone up by mistake. it went up by mistake when shitcoin subs thought reddit would use donuts and they were wrong, when they thought kraken would list, wrong, when they thought rcps would be exposures to reddit ipo.. wrong. 

i know this is hateful cynicism shaped again but it's an undeniable core of truth again.
