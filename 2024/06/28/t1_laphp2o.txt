I see your suggestion, but it would be extremely confusing. Poll after poll, within a governance week too, seems unnecessary.

Basically you would favor occasional, flexible contests, funded through Donut Initiatives, rather than recurrent weekly contests? That's how we've been doing it over the years.

It still puts the treasury to good use and doesn't interfere with the current distribution.
