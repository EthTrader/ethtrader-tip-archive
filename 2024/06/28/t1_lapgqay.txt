There really was a lot of money made along the way, thousands and thousands of dollars for normal people which is amazing. It went up around 50 times from low to high last year, so several people held through an absolute dream scenario in crypto, some who still didn't sell or have so many there wasn't enough liquidity.

on the other hand as you say, people have been through a bit of an emotional rollercoaster here buying high after watching the gains and then endured some fairly depressing pullbacks, to an extent very typical of crypto in general. which is why it's super important to have some reality like my comments thrown in, it's very irreaponsible to let people think a cex might list or that this is some sort of 10x meme potential. the situation is more likely than not to actually lose them their hard earned money.

  
i think this is why mods are against a paid cex listing and also exactly why the members want one, a small number of insiders maybe make big profits and the newcomers take losses when these pullbacks happen.

  
i say all that and then guarantee tomorrow some memecoin of somebodies pet will make people 20x returns, nobody knows shit ðŸ˜„
