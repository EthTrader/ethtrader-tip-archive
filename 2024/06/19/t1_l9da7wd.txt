I already said several times what I think about airdrops.

I don't think they're what they used to be. Imo, an airdrop is supposed to be something that we receive in our wallets unexpectedly, and we go like "Oh look, free crypto. That's nice".

Now, it is full of farmers who want to earn free money, using sybils if necessary, and projects that take advantage of these people to generate volume.

It's a cheap marketing tactic. I think this type of culture is completely unnecessary in the industry.
