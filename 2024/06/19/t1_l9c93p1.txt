Thanks for saying this. There are serious weaknesses in this crypto and I get pushback when trying to explain, as if they're just trying to see if mindless positivity does anything. If you lose logical discussion you get echochambers and at points this has been one unfortunately.

They probably aren't getting a cex listing and so many other alts stand a way higher chance at a 10x, but you can't earn those for free.

Encouraging to see the spam reduce lately, that's been good.
