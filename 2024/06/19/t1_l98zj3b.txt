I'm definitely in more 'matured' space now than during my first cycle.

Have been burnt by impatience and FOMO already - and am much more composed now when it comes to the financial decisions.

New tokens of course, experiencing their first bull run, far more likely to hit an ATH - as old tokens have last cycles bag holders desperate to take profit. There may be one or two exceptions if a project really is a major player in the space.

That said, people don't need ATH's to make some good money from their investments either, it depends on when they bought it too.
