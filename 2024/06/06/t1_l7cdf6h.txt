Ah, bought the top did you? Rookie mistake.

On a more serious note, the trick to make money in shitcoins / memecoins is to get in before anyone else. It’s really that simple.

Once the market cap gets to a certain amount, too many CEX listings start happening, and it’s being mentioned in the crypto media, it’s probably a bit too late. Because that’s the exit liquidity phase.
