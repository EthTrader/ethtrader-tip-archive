Each post created incurs a 'posting fee' - this is to help prevent spam, duplicate posts and low quality content.  


Unfortunately, this also can be subjected to abuse by downvoters, as to break even from the posting fee, a post must receive 3 upvotes - and nasty people who downvote try to sabotage other users posts.  


This will be very different going forward, as rewards are now counted by tips, such as this one.
