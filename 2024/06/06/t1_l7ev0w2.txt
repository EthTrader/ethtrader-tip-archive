I agree. I mentioned that the otherday… some proposals recently seem to be fueled by things like jealousy of others and based on emotions and not really with afterthought. I’m a news poster but I can see a world with a lesser multiplier. But 0.1x you’re taking the pi*s imo. That’d just lead to people spamming memes. 

Memes are fun and all but not a sub with only memes. They have little to no added value. News has way more value, for me anyway. I actually enjoy coming to Reddit cause you know most important news will be posted here within minutes, cuz people F5 all day haha

A sub with Only news tho, I can see why you’d want to lower the multiplier and I’d be fine with 0.75x or 0.5x.
