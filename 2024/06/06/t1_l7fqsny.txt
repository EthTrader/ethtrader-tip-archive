I'm a fan yes but is just who did the most volume the best way to do this? 

For example let's say the top wallet for volume traded in total is $1000 and is 1% up. Let's say another user traded $350 but is 15% up. I don't think we can call it a trading contest if the user with $1000 volume is the winner

It shouldn't just be based on % either because if someone just risked a couple dollars I dont think they should win. Maybe there could be a minimum amount that needs to be traded to qualify ðŸ¤” then the winner is based on the amount of donuts/dollars gained 

Just throwing my thoughts out there!
