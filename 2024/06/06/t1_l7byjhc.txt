Also, thhe post ratios (even if they were accurate here) would change again once Matt's data is incorporated due to the recent proposal to NOT increase donut issuance with voting rewards, but instead incorporate that bonus into the score data (Similar to how r/cc did it) - in other words, bigger voting bonus, lower ratio.

This will also impact post fees xD
