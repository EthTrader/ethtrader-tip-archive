I certainly could understand where the proposal came from, and I would have supported it if the Tip2Vote proposal was not also put forward.

But by voting for Tip2Vote I decided to oppose the Link multiplier reduction.

There was nothing wrong with the proposal itself, but those who voted might not have seen the bigger picture or the synergy between the other proposals.
