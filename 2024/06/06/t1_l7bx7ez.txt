Whilst I am happy with the result, I think in future manual counting of votes should not happen, unless it is specified in a clause with special exception.

This is probably something that needs to be written into the constitution as well.

Additionally - re-voting of polls should only occur if quorum is not reached, correct?

This is feedback I believe needs to be incorporated into the constitution as these define the fabric of the purpose of the Governance Token.

I Appreciate the ongoing efforts to develop the Sub/Token.
