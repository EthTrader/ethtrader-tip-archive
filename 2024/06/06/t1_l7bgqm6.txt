Correct. 1v1. Eth stake vs Eth stake! It was heated, it was intense. But the Ministry of Silly Tipping secured a critical hit on the final attack, and victory was celebrated!

Actually, I had no idea what the hell I was doing, but I don't think the opponent did either.  I got lucky and switched from "accurate mode" to "aggressive mode" and then landed a lathal blow xD
