I also do think the elections have a big impact on the ETFs. They don’t want to risk losing votes of the crypto enthusiasts. Considering they’ve achieved nothing tangible, in terms of innovation and adoption, over the past months, or even years.

I hope whatever happens in the US, turns out to be the best for the crypto industry
