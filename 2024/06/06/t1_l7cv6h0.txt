I'd say atleast 50% of the users here are in fact banned from r/cc

Some would say r/cc unfairly banned a lot of users, and only very few would admit they were indeed fairly banned. However, who were permabanned, actually engaged in civil conversation with r/cc mods and had their temp banned reversed into a 1 or 3 month ban.

R/cc also had much more moderators in charge, with some mods assigned more specifically in roles towards hunting alt accounts and content curation. 

Bigger team means more diverse assigned roles.
