i think because canada is a major oil & gas exporter it's easier for it to keep electricity, heating, fuel prices under control also unlike europe it's trade with china doesn't pass through the red sea so it's imports costs didn't rise, both factors make it easier for canada to keep inflation under control hence being able to decrease rates to 4.75%, i don't think it's possible for other g7 members to perform any close to canada.

i think eth new ath is only few weeks away
