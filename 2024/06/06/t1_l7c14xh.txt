Polymarket having Vitalik's investment is a sign of "this is a good project to invest in". However I dont know if it is already priced in because it is public knowledge. The platform's has achieved good amounts of funding and also a big surge in active users which also indicates potential. If they launch a token, it will boost its popularity so I think it is a project worth keeping an eye on!
