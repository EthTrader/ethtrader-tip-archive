>“We are thrilled to team up with Polygon Labs and help provide Polygon CDK developers with onchain alternatives for their cloud infrastructure needs,” said Harrison Hines, CEO at Fleek. “The goal is to develop web services that provide real benefits from both a decentralization and self-sovereignty perspective, as well as from a performance, cost, and developer experience perspective.”

>“Accessibility, democracy, and freedom of choice are among the core principles of Web3, and Fleek’s vision aligns with this ethos. By offering Polygon CDK developers more freedom in which tools they prefer for their cloud infrastructure needs, the Polygon network will become even more flexible and diverse—accelerating the evolution and maturation of the blockchain space as a whole,” noted Sandeep Nailwal, Co-Founder at Polygon Labs.

Looks really promising.
