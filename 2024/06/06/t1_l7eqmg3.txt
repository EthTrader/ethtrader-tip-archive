I would say if it’s excessively decentralized, then it’s not worth it. Honestly, excessive decentralization will eventually ruin a project, believe me.

Without coordination, a well established team, and someone to “lead” or call the shots, there is no going forward. Excessively decentralized systems lack communication, synergy, coordination. And for a project to move forward, everybody must be on the same boat, rowing together in the same direction.

That’s just my opinion anyway.
