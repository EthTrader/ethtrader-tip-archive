Wall Street, Wall Street, Wall Street. Always up to something.

Basically the argument is that Ethereum supports a wide range of applications beyond just currency (this is what Vitalik talks about constantly). This makes it a versatile platform, like an "app store" for the crypto industry.

I'm not a massive fan of having Wall Street involved, but this could attract more institutional and retail investors. This is exactly what puts Ethereum ahead of the competition, it's its ability to host these applications.

This could make financial institutions develop and offer new financial products and services on Ethereum. TradFi is getting integrated with DeFi.
