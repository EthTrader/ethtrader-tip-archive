Yeah agreed 100%. I was assuming that too and I think it's the way that most proposals should be done since for example: someone might put a lot of effort into memes not knowing that the ratio gets nuked and at the end of the month there is a vote and it applies to everything already done with a ratio=1 in mind. I would encourage people to clarify that such changes should take place from the start of the next round. With the news change for example a lot of people would've ended in big debt that otherwise wouldn't have shared that many news articles. (Not myself, I would've actually benefited from the rule change but still prefer news to be around as they are). But if rules take place after the vote and it gets clarified in the proposals we avoid that issue.
