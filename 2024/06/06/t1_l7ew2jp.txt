Above 20k easily. The thing is if less people tip it's not that there will be less donuts distributed sir. The people who got the lesser amount of upvotes will benefit and gain hard anyways. There will always be the same amount of donuts distributed and the top earners will earn. What would kill the distro is a retroactive multiplier change but that shouldn't be made imo and I don't think it will.  !tip 1
