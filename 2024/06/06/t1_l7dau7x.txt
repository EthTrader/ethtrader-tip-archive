>I think it makes more sense to put through multiplier changes for the next round and never the one that just passed.

yes, it makes more sense. But governance/law is about being as least ambiguous as possible. hence, ambiguity in the policies logically dictate that the rule, once passed, be implemented as soon as possible.

These are things that the constitution and policies need to specify.

Theres a reason why r/cc had such a huge MoonWiki - they covered all bases, and they're already closer to us to finalizing an official constitution - soon they'll finalize up their DAO and resume business as legally compliant as possible.
