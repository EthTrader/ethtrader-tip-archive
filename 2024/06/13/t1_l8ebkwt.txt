\> Do you think not counting reciprocal tips as upvotes for the purposes of allocating DAO donut rewards is a big change? I thought it would be quite a small change.

&#x200B;

I think it's all very subjective. 

&#x200B;

I think our conversation right now, is on-topic, detailed, civil and thought-provoking.

&#x200B;

I have no issues giving a !tip 1

&#x200B;

in this instance.

&#x200B;

I think receiving a tip, and saying, thanks for the tip, and giving a tip back. Is what you want to stamp out.

&#x200B;

But how can you objectively define and police what a reciprocal tip is versus on topic / relevent / in depth discussion

&#x200B;

I think we could go through a slide show on comment chains and different users would have different opinions on should all those comments have been tipped or not?  


I'm bias, because Column B involves me.  


Column A for example, you probably think, nope, those don't warrant tips. And I'd agree to that  


Column B - Well, as I said, I'm bias, I believe that discussion does warrant "reciprocal tips"  


But ultimately, how can you define with clarity, a rule that can be objectively moderated, to differentiate these two comment chains?
