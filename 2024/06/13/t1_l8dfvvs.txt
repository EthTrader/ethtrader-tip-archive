> Plot Twist: you wanted to save some donuts and tip less than 1 but hide the less altruistic intentions. Just kidding 

Actually... you're dead on ðŸ¤£  I was the one that created then sub 1 tipping meta - to prove a point!

Given the influx of posts due to the Dynamic Pay 2 Post being implemented, and the influx of alt accounts, I highlighted that the tip reward ratio would drop below 1 donut.

To nip it in the bud, I [proposed the minimum tip requirement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bvaanp/poll_proposal_implement_minimum_tip_amount_for/) - but that didn't have as much interest as I would've liked

To prove my point, I began tipping every post I saw less than 1 donut, because I already knew the reward ratio would be less than 1 based on Nano's weekly updates. I just did so with my own humorous element to it xD

Less altruistic indeed, but the goal was achieved and the next proposal was supported to scrap tip rewards altogether - thus ensuring tips were actually being done with good intention, rather than self-fulfilling intention - but with a truer purpose which was good intention for the overall health of the sub.
