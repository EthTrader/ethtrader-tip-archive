Equally important. One thing I really miss seeing as actual deep dives on projects and tokenomics. r/cc used to have a few users who did those - until their posts got brigaded all the time, especially when their deep dive was critical and more of a 'consider these points before you buy'

It's not always about comparing the prices, but actually diving into the network or the foundation itself.
