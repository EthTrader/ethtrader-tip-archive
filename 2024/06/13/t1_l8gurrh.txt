Just when markets are red and hopium is down, Friendly Airline blows us away with excellent news. You can Matic and Pepe and all other coins, but I'm putting my hope in Donut! 
When I see posts saying donut has no future and no use case, it's kind of sad. Look at the milestones that donut has achieved this year. 

We are early. Let's not forget donut was up 300% at one point. Not much in my portfolio reached that.

Great work team. Friendly I'm betting on you. !tip 99
