With no pay2post fee - some users night simply post low quality memes if they haven't already made 3 posts in the 24 hour period. No repercussion or thought behind it, just an attempt to gain extra donut for no actual effort.

I believe it is still an essential anti-spam measure

Besides... the cost isn't actually that much anyway, people losing their minds over 50 donuts.
