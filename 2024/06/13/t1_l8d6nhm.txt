It probably hits the right buzz words, and if I didn't have so much experience in crypto and these types of tokens, you have definitely piqued my interest!

It would actually be super interesting to host an AMA on another crypto sub that hadn't heard of DONUTs before and see what questions people unfamiliar with the project would have as they try to understand it.

I would suggest hosting an AMA on r/cc - but they are familiar with DONUT and of course MOON.

I wonder if we could manage to host an AMA on a sub specific for such Arbitrum or Sushi or Uniswap.
