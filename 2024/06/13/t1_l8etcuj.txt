As a trader, I really dislike Matic. It’s the stablecoin of L2s. The charts barely have any action, it’s a terrible trade.

As a crypto investor, I believe in the project. Matic is a looooong term investment, the strategy is to accumulate as much as possible under $0.86, stake it and forget about it for a few years.

It’s an asset that should easily trade at around $2, in a bull run scenario.
