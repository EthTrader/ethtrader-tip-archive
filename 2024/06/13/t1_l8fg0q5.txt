This is something NFT's could be handy for. 

I know theres a token called AUDIO...  Audius (AUDIO) is a decentralised music streaming protocol that seeks to give everyone the freedom to distribute, monetise, and stream any audio content.

Haven't looked at it personally though, just seen it on my exchange.
