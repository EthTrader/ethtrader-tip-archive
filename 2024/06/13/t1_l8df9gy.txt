It's a great Dex with a very good UX imo. Now I got two questions for you: 

1) will there be a syncswap token and wen? ðŸ¤£ 

2) Would you push transactions on Linea there even though there seems to be no reward for it. Currently participating in the Surge Program earning LXP through Zerolend. Same question goes for Scroll, I have some liquidity provided on Layerbank and hope for retrospective marks but not sure if trading volume on a DEX will count there. 

Good luck for the competition!
