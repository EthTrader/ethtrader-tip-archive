I don’t think it was needed since we changed rules to be stricter about on topic discussion. That in itself already wiped most ”bad bronuts” if we hadn’t changed the rules on this front and everyone was spamming donut trains, only then it’s make sense to reduce rewards by 50 %. Implementing both made no sense to me
