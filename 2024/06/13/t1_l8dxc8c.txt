**Initial announcement**

>SingularityNET announced that this process will begin on June 11 with the renaming of FET to ASI, followed by the conversion of AGIX and OCEAN tokens on June 13.

**Token conversions**

>The specific conversion rates have been established: 1:1 for FET, 1:0.433350 for AGIX, and 1:0.433226 for OCEAN.

**How?**

>The conversion process, which will take place via SingularityNETâ€™s decentralized AI platform, will use audited migration contracts to ensure transaction security.

This is where buying and holding on a CEX can be beneficial, they can complete the migration for you!

I'm thinking of getting more FET again.
