This is even more reason why we need to nail the balance of content submissions IMO. We don't want to become a sub that only spams news links or memes. The name EthTrader absolutely indicates we should have some more original content, trading advice and chart analysis. !tip 1

IKf we don't have that, then we really are just going to remain a sub where the same people farm DONUTs by posting news links and memes and we fail to appeal to a broader audience.
