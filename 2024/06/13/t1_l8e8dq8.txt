I've said a few times, the issue with tiip2vote, especially for comments, really results in more of a popularity contest.. Many genuine new users won't get tipped much in the first place, plus until there is a written Constitution and a well defined Donut-Wiki (Similar to r/cc Moons Wiki) there is always going to be confusion and difficulty for new users.

Yes, Tip2Vote now shows transparency with votes, but that's not necessarily a good thing in real time. It would be good to see such activities post-mortem.

But you also can't police what people want to tip, or what they appreciate.

That funny joke someone might tip, that detailed analysis someone else might tip. 

Personally, I think the best approach would simply to have been leave the comments rewarded by upvotes as usual, but also reduce the overall comment donut allocation, from 340k down to 300k.

Use that spare 40k to better reward things like nominated comments, or "Posts of the week".

Comment vote manipulation would incur ratio's low enough, manipulating isn't worth it - but a fairer distribution amongst all contributors would return.

Would alts come back? Maybe, most likely. But vote manipulation was minimal on comments, compared to posts, due to the disparity in Donut/Vote Ratios from the separate reward allocations.
