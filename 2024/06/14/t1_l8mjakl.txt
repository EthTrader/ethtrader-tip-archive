This needs to be sent to websites that write about crypto. This is the kind of event that can bring some real exposure for DONUT.

This is the main problem with DONUT. All these exciting things keep happening, but no one outside this sub knows about it. It doesn't even make it to the r/cc sub!

Send this to CoinDesk, Invesvtopedia, Nerd Wallet, Coin Telegraph, etc.! If any of them pick up these stories about DONUT, that would be huge!
