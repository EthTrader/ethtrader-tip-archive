The last post of mine that was nuked, I checked over the sub but didn't see similar post then I typed on the title on Google with the sub name and Reddit at the end and saw similar post was already posted 21hours ago.
The new rules is supposed to be implemented with a bot letting you know before posting that similar post has already been posted based on the pay2post but I don't think it's possible.


But bcos RCC do suck doesn't mean we should do the same. RCC member doesn't pay2post but we do here. Sorry for that though !tip 1Â
