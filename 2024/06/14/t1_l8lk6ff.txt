u said the truth, brave, paper money of today isn't the paper money of yesterday, nowadays it's nothing but a piece of paper that people believe that it has a value which is the only thing that gives it it's current value, while before paper money hadn't a value itself rather it was a prove of gold ownership n the bank where u can exchange it for ur gold at any time so back then unlike today it was legit, today paper money n general but more specifically the USD is a scam because it drains other nations real resources for nothing but green papers technically this is a professional stealing, and what gave the power the USD has today is that countries ended up destroyed or financially broken after the ww2 needed help from the one brother that wasn't affected due to the large ocean separating it from the battle field and due to joining the war late after all parties started to get weaker, so for providing help debts started to b n USD and because it's the biggest economy and the one that was intact after war and also to make it easier to pay any debts plus energy specifically oil was connected to USD after USA took the place of the UK n the middle east so USD started to b other countries reserve as it's more stable and can b used for global trade, until that point everything was cool as it's still connected to gold so countries didn't think twice and there reserves grow n USD that it was nearly n USD only, until the point where the US spends using green papers r obviously more than the gold it has here there were some fear but the US assured that it has enough gold to cover all the green papers, out of fear of economic and financial consequences other counties chose to ignore what's obvious and continue to play n that game, once the US felt it's too late for everyone to get out of the game as everyone's reserve is nearly all n USD so f the USD fall everyone falls with it plus due to the US military power, and the US finally told the world the truth that everyone knew for years, the USD is no more connected to gold after many years of doing so without admitting it's now official and no one can do anything, so everyone is exchanging the real valuable items from diamonds, gold, oil, food, lands and real estates with nothing but green papers. and yes the system was made so that the rich gets richer.

defi is a possible solution, but f ur voting power n decision making is measured by how much coins/tokens u buy or mine this is not decentralization it's the same rich game it's the same rich control, 1% of the population control 50% of the world resources, most of them will always manipulate the game for their own interest making sure the rich gets richer, anyway i hope the future will b better
