>What would the rewards be?

Depends if the mod team approves and what they would be willing to allocate.

Hypothetically, could apply for a Donut Initiative - and allocate 10k and 5k rewards for the two category winners. 

But who knows, I might've typed out this entire concept only to get shut down xD

Or someone could take this concept and unofficially run it
