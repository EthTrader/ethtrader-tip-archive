I'll be curious to see how Linea's is with their Proof of Humanity checks.

Most people should direct their anger towards the "influencers" who recommended certain farming strategies - I received a decent ZKSync airdrop, but I certainly go above and beyond the way some "guides" and suggestions did.

Perhaps ZKSync should have announced they did the snapshot earlier, as it seems there was a lot of hype for farming the project in April and May, when the snapshot was in fact taken end of March.

Or perhaps, farmers can accept part of the gamble is not knowing what criteria and what time frame... otherwise, everyone will qualify, and everyone will complain the airdrop was only worth $10.
