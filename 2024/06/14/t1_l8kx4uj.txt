Yeh... entering a sub and seeing the same story posted 5 or 6 times in the front page is unappealing as well.

Duplicate stories don't get removed fast enough... plus, if my post is gonna get nuked, I'd rather it go after 10 mins, not 10 hours.

We need a greater range of content being published, and with Tip2Vote, comedy is barely being posted anymore.

We also don't want comedy and low quality trash memes to flood the front page either!

These are delicates balances that take time to tweak
