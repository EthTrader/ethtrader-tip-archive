Not sure how old you are but if you’re in your early 40’s this probably was part of your childhood.. 

Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Method Man, RZA, GZA.. It all brings back memories.. 

A few of them passed away already, so knowing there’s another album they’ve been working on for 6 years and only one copy of it.. 

This is going to make millions! !tip 1
