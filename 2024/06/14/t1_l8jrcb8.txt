Complicated issue.

There's a difference between using a protocol somewhat organically in hopes of getting an airdrop, or aggressively sybil farming a project to get as much money as possible.

Seems like they actually rewarded many sybils and gave nothing to genuine users that helped grow the ecosystem by transacting on dApps. In my opinion airdrop farming can be a nice way to grow your portfolio while being involved in DeFi, and I think there's a genuine way to do it that has a positive impact on the ecosystem, which is why I was so invested in it for a couple months.

That being said, it's pretty cringe how some people online are making such a big deal about it. They were never entitled to anything in the first place.
