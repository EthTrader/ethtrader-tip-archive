That's only partially true. You're talking about a scenario where crypto has matured enough to get significant price appreciation. When bitcoin and eth were worth just a few dollars, the "barriers to entry" were a lot lower. The narrative of wealth inequality doesn't apply in the same way back then, because anyone with modest means could participate early on.

Crypto gives a unique opportunity to those who recognize its potential early enough. Sure the golden era of early massive gains might be gone, the market operates in cycles. It presents new opportunities for those who are sharp.

This kind of accessibility and potential is nearly impossible in traditional finance, where opportunities are often limited to those with substantial capital, or insider connections.
