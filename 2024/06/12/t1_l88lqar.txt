Yeah - i will most probably dump my allocation right away. 

My key take away from this airdrop is that it makes sense to provide a big amount of Liquidity for a long period of time.

Taking this into account i will transfer that Airdrop into eth and put that eth into ambient liquidity pool on scroll.
