You're right hard to assume.

But I guess the ratio should be high because of T2V.

For example, one of my comments in the post got 25+ updoot, but it only received 1 tip and from the OP.

So, it's my guess that the comments ratio should sky to this round. I can be wrong, but seems more chances are it'll be high.
