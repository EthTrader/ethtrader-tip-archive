News have become drastically more difficult to share with the strict controls on "this content has been posted already" and many articles where just the same from a different source in the past. This will change if mods keep up with their current moderation approach. 

I'd increase the others but let news as they are since they are at a good spot at the moment imo and we have to be careful to not drive users away by reducing the rewards of their content. !tip 1
