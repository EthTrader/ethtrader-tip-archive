1,006,344 moons are in u/TheMoonDistributor 

They have burned 2,486,362 moons this year so far!!!

BULLISH!!

When they eventually get their DAO up and running, they plan to have advertising adjusted so, 50% of moons spent get burned, and the other 50% goes back into the Distributor so they can be recycled to the sub users.
