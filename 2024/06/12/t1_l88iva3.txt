The problem with DONUT in my opinion is, that there isn't enough trading Volume. While mods are saying they don't want wash trading. we need something to higher our trading Volume...

its just way to low to make any big up or down movement..

You could clearly see that when defi\_mama came in with "higher capital" while it was still quite low, if you compare how much money flows into other memes.

If this token gets more traction and trading volume, we will go to the moon.
