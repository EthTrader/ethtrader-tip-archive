If they don't change the criteria to the better it will go under $0,30. Pre market price is already sitting at $0,30.

If they decide to change it to the better we will see something around $0,80 in my opinion.

Nevertheless we will see a huge dump after TGE in my opinion because a lot people got live changing gains and want to realise those.
