I think u/Friendly-Airline2426 can be a really good candidate to lead or be part of that organized group. He has been doing a lot of work in the dark to get really good deals for DONUT with different companies and I think that he has the capacity to sync both stuff to give a push to the marketing, etc. I also believe he is one of the most committed users to make DONUT great.
