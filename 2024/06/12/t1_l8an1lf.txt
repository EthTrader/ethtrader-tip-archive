Yeh, unfortunate timing. I had actually created a [pre-proposal discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1dd6x7k/preproposal_discussion_update_flair_multipliers/) yesterday, and was in the middle of writing this one up and saw the other one get posted - but it neglected the other flairs, and had a different multiplier.

I have added language in "Clarification" to help give the community the choice of what multiplier they think is better for the sub.
