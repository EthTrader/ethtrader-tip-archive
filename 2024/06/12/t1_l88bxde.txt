It’s possible. If the eth reserves start dropping to dangerous levels in CEXs, they’ll have no choice but to refill them.

CEXs are worth millions, and the big ones billions. If they start refilling, it would create an enormous buying pressure, and the price would go up as a consequence. Though, this is very rare as they would need to do it all at the same time, and in a single round. Usually this is a slow process.
