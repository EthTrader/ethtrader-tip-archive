[YES] These seem like respectable ratios given the move to T2V. 

I would have voted [NO] in the past, since comedy posts (memes) tend to get picked by the algorithm and therefore get a lot of upvotes. Literally saw an SBF meme on ethtrader hit 600 upvotes before. Memes have little to no value, besides a ”laugh”

But, yeah, anyway now with T2V I think it does need a buff. And I don’t mind bumping up the other ones u mentioned. Easy [YES]
