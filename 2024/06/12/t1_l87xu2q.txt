Yeah of course! 

I just don't like the thought of newbies coming along and feeling like they have to spend money to become a part of the sub. No one else here had to do it! 

Plus spending the money is just giving them weight for when they upvote others. Essentially what we'd be saying is 'hey people might treat you differently because you don't have much governance weight but if you buy some they might be nicer to you'

I'm not a fan of that. We should not avoid upvoting new users just because they're new. I don't anyway and I'm not sure how much of an issue it actually is. We'll find out at the end of this round when the CSV comes out
