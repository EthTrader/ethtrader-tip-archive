Great analysis! Lower interest rates could indeed bring a bullish sentiment and consequent pump to the crypto market. Big boys are bored out there waiting to put their boring bank money into something riskier and more attractive like ETH and BTC. Also a weaker USD and the hedge against inflation narrative are more reasons to jump into crypto. Today is going to be a really interesting day to watch with CPI data and interest rates decision in the same day.
