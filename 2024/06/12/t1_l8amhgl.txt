> Can we make it so that only original or new memes have this buff?

That would actually be quite difficult to police and enforce - it's easy for someone to add a watermark or tag to something - but worth considering in a separate proposal.

I believe better quality and original comedy would not only gain more tips from users, but more generous tips, thus be more rewarding.

Lesser quality and re-posts would likely have a harder time achieving the required votes to break even, and should not be too substantial of an increase to see the front page full of just comedy.
