If there are 10 sellers selling the same item Amazon comingles the stock and dumps it all into the same 1 bin. It depends what you buy, but it can be a bit of a gamble if you actually get something from a reputable seller and not a scammer abusing the system.

I would never buy supplements, storage (SSDs HDDs), CPUs/GPUs, cosmetics or skin care products, apparel, phones, or anything that plugs into the wall (phone chargers, light switches) from there.

After receiving a piece of clay in place of a CPU I began video recording myself open all my Amazon packages, even if they're $10 in value. They gave me a refund that one time with no questions asked, but I really didn't like being in that position, "you sent me an empty box, uh trust me bro, give my $1000 back pls".
