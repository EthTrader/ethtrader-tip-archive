Depends on the timeframe, actually. I wouldn’t invest in eth or bitcoin expecting to take profits after a month or two. They don’t have enough margin of gains for that.

However, if we’re looking at a 1-year timeframe, then absolutely. Bitcoin is up 119% and eth +88% in a year, and this is after this year’s peak.
