Most people seemed to expect a bit of a downtrend to take place shortly after the halving, so it's amazing that just as many people feel shocked that it actually did happen. I think since 2022 many people have been expecting a Pre-halving pump, post having dump, and still predict the real bull run will kick off later in the year.

We shall see!
