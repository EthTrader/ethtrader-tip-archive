I think opening a position right now is perfect, because both donut and eth are at the "local low". Meaning it's very unlikely that any of them dips more than this (no jinxing plz).

So ideally both move at a similar pace and only go up from here, without major disparities between the two. Then again, there's no such thing as an ideal scenario. Not in this industry.
