Nope.  Maybe theres a chance "we" don 't pay the fee, but someone would have to. Arbitrum sponsorship for example, if our trading volume boomed, and we check all the boxes from everything they required for the grant, perhaps future partnership might be them covering a listing fee.

unlikely to happen - but you see the point... god, it's going to be a challenge to tick all the criteria for the full 10k grant!
