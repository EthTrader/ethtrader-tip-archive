It's got its up and downsides.

Downvote manipulation is no longer a factor.

Upvote manipulation is minimal

Spam has been drastically reduced.

However, donut distributions will have a much lower spread, irregular users might not feel inclined, or even be aware to tip - and low donut holders might not want to tip because they've barely received anything to tip away.

It often results in a popularity contest or reciprocal tipping. 

One of the downsides is it makes it feel more like an exclusive Bronut club and it's even harder for genuine new users to get be a part of it.
