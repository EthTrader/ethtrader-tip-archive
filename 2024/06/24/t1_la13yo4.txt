That’s a good point: with that said. Feel free to state your own ideas if u have better ideas to grow the sub. Not doing anything, whining, won’t do anything. We need to work as a community if we want this to become better. I can’t see it being hard to implement so i think it’s not a bad idea to do. From there onwards, I welcome new ideas to onboard new users.
