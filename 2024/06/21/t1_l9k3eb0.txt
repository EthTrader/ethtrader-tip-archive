Probably the one that seemed to anger the most people, ZKsync. The anger spread so wide that I saw people discussing it in many non-ZKsync discords. Then there was the team's teaser like "We know you're angry, we're listening to feedback, please give us two days to think about it" followed up with "ok we've listened to all of the community but we're not changing anything" haha
