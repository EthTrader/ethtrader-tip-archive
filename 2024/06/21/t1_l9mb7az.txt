> Bunch of new users interested in Eth, but they wonâ€™t register because all the rules will be alien and too complicated for outsiders. So they will comment but remain anon/unregistered

Doubt it. Users won't register because;

1)  they arn't aware

2) don't know how (remember lots of moon farmers didn't come here because it was complicated, so they went to avatar subs because they had the vault linked to their account already)

3) some users simply are not interested, or skeptical of DONUT
