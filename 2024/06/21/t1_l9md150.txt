I've never heard of it to be honest. There are a lot of new staking sites coming out; this is both great for easier accessibility for users, but also risky as more options will also lead to more bad options.

I'm definitely sticking to the more long-term reputable staking options.

I'm got some on Etherfi, but also make use of Coinbase CEX staking favour the older Everstake platform.
