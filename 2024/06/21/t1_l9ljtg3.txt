>Kenyan police have dropped an investigation into allegations that Worldcoin had illegally collected and transferred users' personal data, according to a police document, paving the way for the cryptocurrency project to resume its operations.

>Authorities suspended Worldcoin in August last year, following privacy objections over its scanning of users' irises in exchange for a digital ID to create a new "identity and financial network".

This is interesting. They don't give any reason why they dropped the investigation. Maybe there's no tangible evidence, maybe there's something else.

>"Upon review of the file, the Director of Public Prosecutions ... directed that the file be closed with no further police action," Kenya's Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) wrote in a June 14 letter to Coulson Harney, a law firm representing Worldcoin.

I think there's something off about Worldcoin. Ever since they did that eye scanning campaign, it just triggers my spidey senses.
