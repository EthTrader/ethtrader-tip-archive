I agree.

I also think both systems are garbage.

In EU, esp in smaller countries, you have democracy and capitalism but in reality that only exist on the paper.

Everything is controlled by few private individuals who have monopoly in everything . 

When leadership changes, they put their own people from political party again. Nothing changes for ordinary people.

Food is getting more expensive from private markets, inflation is destroying everything. 

Life is getting more and more expensive each month while people who have control are getting richer.
