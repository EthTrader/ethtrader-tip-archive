Availability's data availability architecture will work with Layer 2 projects like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, StarkWare, and zkSync.  
  
Avail recently said it is working closely with OP Labs, one of the main contributors to Optimism, to make it easier to integrate with its ecosystem.  
  
Orbit chain builders will not have to rely on AnyTrust's external Data Availability Committee to publish data in Arbitrum. Instead, they can use Avail DA.
