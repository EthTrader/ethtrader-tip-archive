In addition to an essay written above, Camelot offers artificially high bonus APR's - due to GRAIL being awarded in SPLIT with their xGRAIL token.

If you want to redeem said xGRAIL token at a 1:1 ratio with GRAIL, you need to wait 6 months.

If you want to stake your grail or xgrail, you receive more xgrail. So if you actually want to cash in some of those rewards, you'll be waiting half a year and probably watching their value diminish the whole time.

Grail currently has 18% of its supply in circulation.

I'm not sure what "difficulties" mods are experiencing getting DONUT rewards into Sushi, but I really don't see the grass being any greener on the other side, the reward scheme is laughable, and if Sushi do decide to incentive our pool with $SUSHI, we can withdraw and sell that immediately.
