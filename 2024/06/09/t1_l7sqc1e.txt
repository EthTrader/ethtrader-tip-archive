I agree ðŸ’¯. Sushi is very well known and easy to use. Going to a smaller Dex will hinder new users. I personally would exit liquidity for a good while.

We have just begun the journey with Sushi that I thought, was going well. 

My biggest fear is that we switch to Camalot and then a couple of months we are switching again. If that's the case it will make Donuts look like somewhat of a joke.

Give Sushi 365 days and then make a decision. !tip 2
