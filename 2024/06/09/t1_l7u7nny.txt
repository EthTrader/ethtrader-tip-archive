very hard to keep my thoughts short and simple...

I hate that we have to chose complexity to solve a shitnuts problem, if that was even the real problem...

anyway, on post it's ok, but the feeling is that cuts us from the rest of the Reddit unregistered world, and it sucks.

on comments, I totally don't get it ðŸ¥´
