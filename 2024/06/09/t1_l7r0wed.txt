[NO]

My history as an LPer includes being the 4th largest liquidity provider on Sushi.com for Moons prior to the sunset.

I'm currently the 2nd largest provider for DONUT on Sushi.com

I also provide liquidity for Moons on Camelot.

Ultimately the migration to ONE is a very recent move, as is the listing with Sushi. We are only just beginning to build up volume and have users used to trading on that DEX.

If we had been with Sushi for over a year, then perhaps I'd consider moving with more thought, but it's only been a few months.

Whilst I don't know what it has been like behind the scenes with communication, I do know my user experience with Sushi has been good enough to not turn my back on them - especially after such a short time frame with the DONUT listing.

I have had issues withdrawing rewards in the past which they they troubleshoot quite quickly when submitting a ticket on their discord - and it was an unusual error as well.

I do not see the upside of moving to Camelot being greater than the downside of moving away from Sushi - a larger and more established DEX.
