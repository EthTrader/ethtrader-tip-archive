It's worth something usually during the peak of a bullrun. Last bullrun, some people with enough rewards bought hardware wallet with theirs. Some got the price slashed in half, by using their rewards. I got airdrops and NFTs worth a few hundred dollars with mine. I still collect on both Coingecko and Coinmarketcap. !tip 1
