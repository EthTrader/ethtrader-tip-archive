I didnt notice any decrease in activity. Im active in other crypto subreddits and this is by far the most active one. What I did notice was less spam and 'Bronut' nonsense and less repetitive posts. Theres still too many posts about ETH going to 4000 which is annoying still but not as it was like a month or two ago. Seems like most people are here for the free crypto myself included though so not judging !tip 1
