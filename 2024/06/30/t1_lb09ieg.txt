If some will see the high comment and post ratio, some will come back :D

But I wish the old system for the daily too. It is too quiet. Sometimes the daily is 30 minutes without appearing a new comment. Feels badâ€¦

We are between 800 and 1200 comments in the daily. I remember days with 3000 - 4000 comments.
