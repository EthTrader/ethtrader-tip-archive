Regarding the gifs. I think the owner of the account deleted the account because I can't find them on official Giphy site. u/Cyrus-114, u/Cyrus_114 (can you throw some light on this?)

Regarding the activity, I was quite surprised too. I think we must find the way to bring human beings back to the sub but not sure how.

I think too much things happened at the same time xD
