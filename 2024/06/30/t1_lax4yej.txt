I'm going to say [NO]

CONTRIB should be awarded for actually contributing. There are other ways we can award additional CONTRIB for users. Such as my recent proposal to award bonus CONTRIB for those who participate in governance.

We can also award additional CONTRIB for upcoming things like Post of the Week and Contest participation.

As much as I like to idea of more CONTRIB being awarded, and some buy pressure to come, I think the core principle of CONTRIB being a representative score of CONTRIBUTION to the sub/community is vital.
