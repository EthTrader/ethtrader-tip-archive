I'm not convinced. I like the concept, I like the idea of further rewarding quality content.

But in practice, quality content, low quality content, depends on who's online as to you get tipped or not.

I'd toy with the idea of splitting the comment rewards allocation of 370k DONUT into 2 pools, for example, 185k DONUT to be split by upvotes; and 185k DONUT to be distributed amongst tips.

Tips would be used to further reward informative contributions, while upvotes would reward the general.

However, the usual downsides to this concept of course are voting rings, manipulation and subjectivity towards what content should get tipped in addition to upvoted.
