I spot trade basically every day, as that’s where I get most of my income from. Usually I have what I call a “main trade”, which is a coin that allows me to swing trade consistently, many times a day or at least many times a week.

Usually it’s L2 coins, memecoins, or low market cap tokens. RCPs included.

Now what I do differently is that I allocate a portion of my profits to eth. Then use it to either provide liquidity or simply increase the stack and hold. Sometimes, if I’ve made my monthly goal already, I’ll even put it all on eth.

DCAing into eth and Bitcoin is a great stable, reliable way to invest, but it’s boring, not as profitable, and not for me.
