This! While I totally get the wish for more quality content theres only so much content that can be created. 

When you limit the activity like that DONUTs can't generate value and then you don't need them at all because you can't really earn anything here. But earning was initially supposed to motivate people to make higher quality content, by giving them something more than worthless reddit-karma.
