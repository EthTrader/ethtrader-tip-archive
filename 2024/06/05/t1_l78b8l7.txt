Yea, we're out here talking like we're experts and know 100% what's gonna happen. ðŸ˜…

I think overall you can't go wrong with bitcoin, eth and L2s. Everything else is either for people who trade for a living, which is my case, and gamblers.

I will say though, it's a shame ARB doesn't allow staking. Considering the tokenomics are pretty identical to MATIC. But I think I read somewhere that it could happen soon.
