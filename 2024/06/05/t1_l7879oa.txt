IMO - is it a good long-term hold? God no  


Is it a good short term hold? I think so.  


ARB gives me similar vibes to ALGO, massive token unlocks during the year leading up to, and of the halving, meant that despite increased supply, buying pressure still resulted in the token rising.   


It's the bear market you have to be scared of, and if I'm holding ARB (which I am), I'd be looking at selling next time it pushed its ATH.
