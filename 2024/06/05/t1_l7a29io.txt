I don't really feel like much has changed. I think only the manipulators/cheaters were the ones who were really upset about it. Seems like some of them dumped their DONUT and stormed off in protest. Good. We don't want or need them.

Overall, I think it will be a bet positive for the long-term health if this sub and, by extension, DONUT.
