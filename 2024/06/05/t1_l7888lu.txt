>ARB gives me similar vibes to ALGO, massive token unlocks during the year leading up to, and of the halving, meant that despite increased supply, buying pressure still resulted in the token rising.

Yea, honestly I can't argue with that. But what would you consider long-term in this particular case, though?

In the thread, I was thinking anything above a 1 year period. So let's say you buy RIGHT NOW, at this price, and hold for a year. By then it's like $2.50 or even $3, assuming the real bull run comes. That's some good gains, considering it was a long-term investment.
