Copying the comment I made in the daily here:

I know you all feel kind of lost or with a weird feeling in your chest with the new [](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/) changes. I feel the same and a lot of users I have talked about it feel the same way. Don't worry and congratulations, you are human!

This is a normal feeling when humans face uncertainty or big changes. However, I believe that this is just the first step towards something new and probably good for the sub. Just embrace it positively and think in ways to improve it and share it with the community.

Let's make this place greater and convince those dormant accounts to come back thanks to our amazing Ethereum related content!

Enjoy the day BroNuts!
