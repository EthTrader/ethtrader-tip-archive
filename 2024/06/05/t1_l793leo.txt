I believe ARB has strong fundamentals and I believe that we still dont know what price can reach in a real bull run because it was released during the winter. My bet is that this coming bull run it will shine crazy but I dont like it as a long term investment (more than one cycle).

I think ARB must be sold in the bull run and bought back in the next winter. Also I am not comfortable with projects that unlocks tokens.
