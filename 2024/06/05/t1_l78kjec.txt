I dont see the point your making. All you have said is now what people were doing before will be public xD

If anything that would make manipulation less.

On the daily if someone replies to me you know what I do? Yeah you guessed it I upvote them! Now I have to tip them instead. That isn't manipulation that's me upvoting people for interacting with me.

Here, have an upvote!
