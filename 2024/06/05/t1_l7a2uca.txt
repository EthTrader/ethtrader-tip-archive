I do like ETH and L2s but will respectfully disagree a bit and express that I enjoy my time using Solana a lot. And personally most of my transactions went through costing almost nothing. Good dapp experience with protocols like Kamino and Sanctum as well. I think there is a future for both and Solana might fix their issues. !tip 1
