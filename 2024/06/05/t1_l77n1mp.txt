\[YES\] This is really a great idea and reading it just made me think about the contests rewards. Maybe it could be a possibility to make Contests rewards follow something like 50% DONUT and 50% ETH. Maybe this could attract more outsiders to participate in the contest while somehow promoting them too. Also this 50/50 reward could somehow push the winners to provide those rewards into liquidity. Just thinking loud.
