I think the market can reach a global market cap of $5 trillion until then. Maybe until 2030.

As more people become familiar with crypto, the user base expands. Improved user interfaces, easy to use platforms, and growing acceptance of crypto for everyday transactions will help in terms of adoption. More businesses accepting crypto as payment will increase demand and integration into everyday commerce. Companies like Tesla, PayPal, Ferrari, and many others have already started taking crypto, and it's only going to keep spreading.

Also, there's tokenization. Traditional assets like real estate, stocks, and art can be tokenized now. This will increase liquidity, accessibility and visibility. Especially for Ethereum. This opens the market to all kinds of investors and opens the door for more value flowing into the crypto industry.

Hedge funds and asset managers are already allocating portions of their portfolios to bitcoin and ether. Big investments from these entities will help a lot in terms of market cap.

Even more conservative institutional investors like pension funds are already investing in crypto.

And of course, the ETFs.  The approval of bitcoin and ether ETFs made it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to the market. More new money coming in. Now there's even talks of altcoin ETFs.
