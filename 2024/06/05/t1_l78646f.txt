Honestly I'm kinda worried about large institutions like BlackRock getting into the crypto market. These institutions have vast resources and influence, making them overpowered market participants. They DO NOT lose, and prioritize profit above all else.

I think their involvement's going to generate tons of (new) capital inflows, which can inflate the prices. But this is 100% going to lead to market manipulation, thus disadvantaging smaller investors and retail traders.
