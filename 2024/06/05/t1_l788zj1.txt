Relevant!

Same mindset as you, I'm considering end of 2025 long term - thats closer to 1.5 years.

If I had to take a stab, I'd say the sweet spot is going to be about 6-9 months from now - and as far as investing goes, I'd consider that short term. 

But, it's foolish to think in absolutes for timeframes too, it's going to depend on other market conditions, and of course, how ETH is going. xD
