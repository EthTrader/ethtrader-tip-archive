I said this on the last RCP Talk, they have two choices:

* they either stop burning Moons earned from advertising purposes, and allocate them to the treasury to distribute them.

* they create a new token, which can be minted and managed by a multisig. Like donut. Probably airdrop it in a 1:1 ratio to OG holders too.

It’s simply not possible to ensure viability of distributions and supply burns at the same time. It’s either one or the other.
