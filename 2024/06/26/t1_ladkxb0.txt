Yeah of the people here a handful are really trying, many people lack the skills to dev or to actually help, so end up trying to engage with people and others and look for solutions to things and that is very admirable.

hard truths now but if the price goes up, people will flock to the sub. It is definitely about money and earning money. I don't think people give two f\*cks, flying or otherwise, about voting or governance. This is crypto and for an industry being so open and honest about problems with communities I would want to see a crypto community being slightly more honest about it's intentions - theyre treating donut like a useless memecoin with which to become instantly wealthy by generating fake hype and empty promises while stacking for free with their time, just waiting for the day to dump them all. cex and whales are smart, they do research on the community, holders, members, on trading patterns, volume.

  
i know the 14 remaining people won't give up, but neither will they change their minds or admit mistakes when they have a bias monetary interest in something not being a massive balls up. They speak as if their words change phsyical reality or other silliness of that ilk.

  
kudos to the people sticking this out, I guess I'll be here as well, but seeing this more like a moonshot or a complete gamble after breaking my own promises myself about never spending any real mental energy here lol.
