Were there any cheaters that actually produced decent content?

They mostly spammed news links or DONUT gifs or GM bronut and the same generic 4 word comments across multiple acocunts.

Whether they were 1 account, 3 accounts of 5 accounts, the only thing they added was fake volume.

If someone wanted to they could find a way to get back into the community and start from scratch anyway -  but, I don't think you'll be finding some valuable contributor amongst the banned users.
