I did a avatar + donuts give away on this sub months back, inviting all other RCC communities to participate. The contest was about creating an avatar mash up and the participation was great, so many new wallet registered 😁

I then stopped caring about this sub, so there won't be more made by me.

But anyway, it's an effort single users can do, but it's way easier with the community bot implementation and some mods weighting in imo
