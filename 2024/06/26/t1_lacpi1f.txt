Another idea of ​​mine would be to deduct 10% from the total for each bronut who receives donuts in a distribution and put that amount in the "Bronut Chest" until we reach a certain amount, let´s say $10k. What do you think about this idea?

Yeah I love this idea but as it'll be like we the community are the ones working together saving up to make the CEX listing happen. I'm pretty sure if CEX happened, it'll invite more users and make donut 🍩 more valuable. I don't even know how RCC do it but MEXC was the first that list them moon too. I hope community agree to this as we're the only one that can make donut listing happen as mods isn't interested in it. !tip 1
