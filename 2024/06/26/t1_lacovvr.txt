The mods are against it for more reasons than just money. We're free to petition whoever we want to list but we already turned down MEXC and another, the latter offered to list for FREE and we still said no. So it's not about money or raising any in the first place.

Banano and GONE both got MEXC listings and the Gone price went down! A cex listing is not a guarantee at profit.

Loads of projects have gone up in the time Donuts have just bled, and many more will make more gains than this moving forward. 

Let's be honest with this and be honest with each other - 

You want Donuts to make you rich, quickly, as a result of big gains from a cex listing, so you can dump them all and take the money away. Not only are whales and cex not stupid, they will 100% see the hundred people earning these for free, contributing bugger all, buying nothing,never providing LP just waiting to dump the moment their exchange lists.

It won't happen now or soon, there's no wilpower, no people, no desire, mods actively against it, no way to raise any money, no volume, no way to get any volume, no new members.

Please for our sanities sake, see this for what it is - half of a governance token on an eth sub, not a meme not a joke, a legit utility token unintended to make anyone rich.
