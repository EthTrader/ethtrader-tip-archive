For the supposed size of this sub, it’s a shambles… I rarely ever see new users. Hope to make some ways to improve that. I tried today, talking about collabong with RCC subs, especially ConeHeads, seeing thay they are a big sub with 27K CONE holders (VS us, 6K DONUT).

I encourage everyone to keep pumping out ideas for how to grow this sub… it’s so dead!
