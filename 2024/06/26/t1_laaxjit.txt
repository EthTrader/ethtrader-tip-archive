I'm looking forward to it, BLAST has been incredibly easy to farm points. I haven't got a huge amount of gold, but haven't done too much activity other than gaining the multiplier bonuses.

The bulk of my points coming from passive yield - which means, I've already earned more from that than GAS fees i have spent - meaning any airdrop is a nice little bonus.
