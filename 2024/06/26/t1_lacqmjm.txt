its not a bad sentiment or thought process but as a clearly intelligent human being I would hope you can be slightly more real about the chances of a cex listing and all the negative outcomes that can leave us in a way worse place than now.

  
its super unrealistic and it might not even help, even if you personally aren't 'only' here for the money, I would hazard a guess that money is a top 2 motivator for every member and such the influence and biases that form from that are inevitably angled towards transforming Donuts from half a governance token into some get rich quick memecoin which it was never designed or run to be.

  
it's the lack of realism that's the problem, cex will see and know
