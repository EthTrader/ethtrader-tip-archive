I'm sure the chronic cheaters are already back, and there are still some accounts to catch. 

But yeh, if you look at all the accounts banned in the last 3 rounds... how  many of them make comments of more than 6 words?

If someone really wanted to learn over a new leaf they can - but I don't think we should actively welcome them back.  If they did want to start genuinely contributing, and created a new account, waited to organically build up the karma requirements and then participate, it's probably better for them NOT to be associated with a banned account anyway.
