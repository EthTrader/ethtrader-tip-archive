u/Lillicia_Golden_SHIB do you still think it might be worth to stake some Atom and Tia? I didn't want to jump on the Tia train because of the terribly inflationary tokenomics. Now that it diped it's still a hard swallow but a bit better. 

Another point of reluctance is that I don't want to be actively checking all the time if there is a cosmos ecosystem airdrop. Is there a way to easily track it? 

Thanks for the info and hope you did well wist AST !tip 1
