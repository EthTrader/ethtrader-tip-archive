No harm in users tipping DONUT in some of those subs if CommunityCurrencyBot is coded to handle DONUT in the respective sub. 

Otherwise, theres nothing stopping you guys who are active in Avatar subs from awarding a small DONUT prize to users as a giveaway/raffle prize on-chain either - you could do that immediately without any dev work required.
