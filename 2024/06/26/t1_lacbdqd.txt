We could do DONUT raffles but I think the efficiency of having CCBot integrated is much better. I’m not a dev but seeing that such bot exists already, i don’t think much dev work is even needed to add this function.

If this were to happen, I’ll be trying to do my part by tipping users DONUT here and there since I frequent r/bucketheads. I could do the raffle, but i don’t think i have enough ideas to keep pumping out raffles
