This type of market is designed to rekt traders lol

In markets like this you're better off doing intraday trades that work best in these conditions imo. My current strategy actually works best in times like this. 

No more worrying about if eth will go up or down if you're just trading the crab, just a mechanical entry model for these ranging markets.

Good post OP !tip 2
