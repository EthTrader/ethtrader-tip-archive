This is important information. I try to follow all these steps very carefully. So far, of those listed, I have only made the mistake of buying FOMO in the beginning.

And something very important in crypto is not to be greedy. Like high APY for example. My second mistake with UST.

I hope there isn't a third!

Be very careful and don't trust anyone, not even yourself!
