The L2 wars are interesting to watch.

At the start of the year I said ARB and ZKSync would be the top Optimistic and ZK Rollups - and I'm still inclined to think this will be the case.

Despite BASE proving to be a solid rival for ARB, and ZKSync airdrop flop, while Linea and Scroll have their airdrop still to come.
