I guess the negative side effect of adoption and regulation is having politics involved in crypto.

The main purpose of crypto was to deviate far away from politics, giving us an apolitical financial system. It's really funny that as crypto gets more mainstream adoption, it gets stuck in the very political structures it aimed to avoid.
