The market is over saturated with L2s, there are just too many. More than necessary, in my opinion. And now there are even L3s.

It’s going to get to a point where there’s way too much offer for the market. This is going to help nobody, not even the protocols themselves. Because it’s going to create an extremely competitive environment.

I guess in a way it can be good, because it forces them to keep upgrading and providing quality products, if they want to stay at the top.
