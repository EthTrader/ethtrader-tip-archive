Ah the crab... [once again the sandwhich heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3QRTToTLzI)

The crab might not be ideal for swing traders, but it's great for those liquidity fiends! xD

Great for those who like to DCA as well, but I personally prefer to lump sum in the dip, so for now I will patiently wait.
