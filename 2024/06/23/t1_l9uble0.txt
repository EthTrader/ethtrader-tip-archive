Becusse, funnily enough, therre was more trading done in general prior to moving to arbitrum, becusee users were hyped and excited about moving to arbitrum.

We had defi_mama who pumped us up to 2-3 cents, arvitrum hype, people taking profits and then buying the dip.

Sure, honeyswap had more donuts being rewarded too, but the bigger factor is the lack of trading being done now
