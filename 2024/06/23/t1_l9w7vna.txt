(Verse 1) 

Yo, it's 50, 

I'm here to clear the air, 

Someone took my name, now that's unfair. 

$3M scam, they say it's on me, 

But I ain't got no ties, can't you see?

(Hook) 

I was hacked, yeah, I was hacked,

 I got no association, that's a fact. 

Crypto scam, they tryna play me, 

But I’m 50 Cent, I’m always staying free.

(Verse 2) 

They took my image, tried to run their game, 

But they don’t know, I don’t play the same. 

I’m about my hustle, my grind, my flow, 

Ain’t no crypto thief, I thought you’d know.

(Hook) 

I was hacked, yeah, I was hacked,

 I got no association, that's a fact. 

Crypto scam, they tryna play me, 

But I’m 50 Cent, I’m always staying free.

(Bridge) 

I built my empire, I earned my throne, 

Ain’t no quick scheme, I do it on my own. 

So listen up, world, get your facts right, 50 Cent’s here, shedding light tonight.

(Hook) 

I was hacked, yeah, I was hacked,

I got no association, that's a fact. 

Crypto scam, they tryna play me, 

But I’m 50 Cent, I’m always staying free.

(Outro) 

So if you hear the rumors, know they ain't true, 

50's on his grind, doing what he do. 

Stay smart, stay sharp, don’t get deceived,

50 Cent’s the real, best believe.
