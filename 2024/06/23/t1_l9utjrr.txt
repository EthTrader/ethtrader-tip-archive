Emotional traders get rekt and seeing so many people trade because of their emotions makes me angry!


I guess the trick is to have 2 portfoliios. 1 where you put 50% of your assets into and ignore it for years.

The other, you can take profits, and trade based on your instincts.

Should be able to salvage something that way xD
