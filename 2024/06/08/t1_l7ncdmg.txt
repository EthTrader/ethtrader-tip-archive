I agree but the thing is, like I said, you will get pretty much nothing or nothing at all. It takes just a few posts to cut your donuts CSV to 0, if they don't perform nicely, which is more than likely.

The disparity of posts to comments was already big enough and with daily gutted, it's much bigger now.
