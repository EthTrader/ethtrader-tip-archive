Yeh, but even if we are comparing since January this year, Moons have been developing at a much faster rate.

Moons migrated to Arbitrum the same week as we did.

Moons have published a draft constitution for review and audit before us

Moons have special membership up and running again before us

And of course, they still have a queue of advertisers/companies buying and burning moons for advertising priivelages
