I currently don't own any OP or STRK.

I have some ARB which I am watching bleed.

As for MATIC, I bought so long ago, it's been staking away in a "set and forget" plan. 

In fact, I just calculated, while my MATIC now sits at -12% from initial investment, adding the stake rewards brings me to +1%

On the other hand, that still isn't as good as what just holding ETH would have done - but if MATIC returns to $1, my initial investment is +19%, but the stake rewards bring it to +33%

Staking in a bear market is certainly a viable approach!
