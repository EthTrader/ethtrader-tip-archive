I think that the spot eth ETFs are gonna significantly boost the visibility and accessibility of crypto as a whole, by allowing traditional finance investors to gain exposure to eth without directly holding or securing it.

The good thing about ETFs is that they reduce security concerns, so it gives peace of mind to the holders.
