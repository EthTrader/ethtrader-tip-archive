After all the changes to this sub, the transition has been fairly smooth. I expected much more chaos at first, but it has been pretty melow.

Things look much cleaner than before. I'm not sifting though so much trash to get to quality content.

A better sub should attract more users. We will lose some but that's life. So far, great work ethtrader team, you guys rock. !tip 1
