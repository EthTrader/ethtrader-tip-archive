>So that's it! Trust me, this is the one project I'm most excited for the rest of this year now that most big projects are too close to TGE and too late to farm now.

>If you had to farm **just one project** for the remaining 6 months of the year, it will be **Monad**. So far no new project gets close to that funding - I repeat: **DO NOT FADE on this one, and get in early!**

I need your home address, ID and full name first. Thanks.
