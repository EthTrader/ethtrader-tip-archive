It's a shame we missed a chance to try to trend alongside real world events; yesterday was [National Donut Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Donut_Day) - any sort of hashtags or public social media shares on Facebook, Youtube, Twitter could do something xD

Of course, it's not always about shilling the token. For those who frequent other subs, even just to share the fact that if a DEV wants to get some cheap market research or advertising done, they can buy/burn DONUT and gain this sub as an audience.
