I don't know how you came to this conclusion about growth so early. It will take a few rounds to see what happens. 

It was very clear that many users won't tip even if they like the content. Of course that's their right, but I think when you exchange a few messages with someone and they tip you a few times you should tip back at least once!

This sub will become a closed circle where old users will exchange tips. It used to be the same, but Daily makes up for it.

Newbies have very little chance of winning donuts with these rules. And then they'll just walk away!

In addition, I agree to introduce a system like it was with the moons. If you sell above a certain percentage (eg above 30%) you will simply be penalized the next distribution.
