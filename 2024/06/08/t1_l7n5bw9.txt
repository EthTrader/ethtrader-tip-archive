I don't quite agree with you. The sub is active, not growing.

The short term grow you are experiencing  will soon stop when next CSV comes and the new users find out all their time and effort granted them zero donuts.

Last CSV there was quite a few complaining about that. Daily is gutted, posts are hard to get tips unless you are one of the well known/active users. Just compare tips on posts of top earners and the rest of users.

The disparity is too big. When new users realize it, they will lose motivation.
