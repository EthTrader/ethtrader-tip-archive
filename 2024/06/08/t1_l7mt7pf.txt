When I started seeing everybody react in the daily, and the headlines coming through ,I got excited that there was this massive dip buying opportunity.

Price hasn't been this low this last month... xD 

In fact, still 24% up compared to 30 days ago.

That said, if you have the spare funds, it feels like a great entry nonetheless!
