Different psychology, yes, downvotes happened - but they happened especially on posts.

Comments, due to far more total upvotes, and less rewards, had minimal downvote manipulation that seemed evident.

Tipping on the other hand, some users might not earn very many tips themselves, and may feel reluctant to give away tips.

Some users might tip more away then they earn, meaning their contributions yield them 0 reward at the end of the round.

It also means, theres no rewards given by genuine users who have not registered for DONUT - which means those trending posts that do gain the attention of new users, don't translate to rewards.
