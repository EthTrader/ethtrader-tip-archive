>However, if ETH’s price touches the SMA and bounces back, it will move upward toward the $4,099 resistance level. Also, should it break below this resistance level, it will continue to move up to test the $4,863 level. ETH may move to create a new high if it rises above the $4,863 level.

Still some hope. Even if goes down, we'll get more time to accumulate before ETFs start trading.
