It's going to be interesting to see how the tipping culture evolves, it's still only early days - and there are some very noticeable patterns developing already.

I think those of us who are in the top50 most rounds are highly likely going to earn more DONUT then ever before, however;

I still stand by my belief that this is going to make it harder for irregular users or new users to "get into" DONUT, and big picture this will hinder the future growth of the token.
