>I would say that news links should receive 0.5x rewards, and original memes should receive 1x rewards, or at least 0.5x. I hope new governance polls are planned for this round.

If nobody else does, I'll be putting forward a proposal to amend flair multipliers, just waiting to get a couple weeks of data first - with the intention to slightly nerf news links, and buff media/comedy/self story

Just need to figure out the appropriate balance based off of atleast 1 full week of data, preferably 2.
