You're right. Comment to vote ring is present. But that's not stopping new users coming to the sub. Are we making them to register for DONUT and CONTRIB?

I don't think so. If they register, they'll have to do exceptionally well with content they contribute to receive generous tips from approved users (20k+ G points).

I hope mods will stop this "tip me tip you" culture.
