While I can’t speak on your specific case, mods now delete duplicate *topics* and not only links. So even if you a source no one has posted, the content itself might already have been covered.

Makes it pretty hard to post imo, because I’ve had posts removed for that exact reason, even if I tried searching the sub beforehand. But it makes the post section better overall
