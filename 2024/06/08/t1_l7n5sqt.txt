Totally right! In fact just the first day I already saw not registered users appearing again in my posts. This is good. However I think we need to adjust some stuff on T2V to make it better like instead of giving your weight in vote to the user you are voting to do it the other way around.

If you have vote weight 1, the T2V you get is 1. This way we encourage holding at least 20K DONUT.
