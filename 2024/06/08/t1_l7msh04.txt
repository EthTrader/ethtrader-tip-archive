Great question!

Trading can still be done on Honeyswap paired with XDAI.

Otherwise, I think the only other bridge available is Omni bridge to send from Gnosis to mainnet. And Arbitrum official bridge which only sends from Mainent to Arbitrum.

Unless there are some other developments I am not aware of.
