You're wrong. I see everyone tipping everyone irrespective of their governance weight or the age of account. Atleast thats what i observed and doing the same atleast for few rounds so nobody has more advantage over others. Its all about engagement, if people just make a post and then don't interact with others, they'll always remain strangers.
