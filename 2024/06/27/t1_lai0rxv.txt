I got your point though but the heap of the blame I think should go to Reddit for giving the Mods a headstart without carrying the community along leaving moon holders at the mercy of the Mods. I understand that those Mods that sold were removed and the remaining ones if you ask me could be trusted as they would have dumped their bags if they want to but they didn't instead they went to work trying to rebuild moons and they took their time and the way they are going about it makes'me to be very hopeful about moonrise, also the RCC Sub being a bigger Sub than ethtrader means they could raise more funds and get more sponsors easier than the latter. IMO donut is a solid project built by a great community but lacks the exposure that moon has.
