Actually - I am second guessing myself and thinking of staking with mitosis on blast. 

From what I hear, they are well funded and under farmed currently. I am currently using them on Linea for LXP-L, maybe Iâ€™ll add some WeETH on blast as well. 

Triple (or more) farming ftw (EL, etherfi points, blast points, mitosis points, Eth stake rewards)
