I'm still celebrating our Sushi DEX listing. It hasn't been long. Give it time and if we have more volume a listing can come but give it time.

We need more utility and some way to burn donuts would be great. Friendly Airline doing good work.

I, for one, will be patient. I believe in Donut and its potential. !tip 1
