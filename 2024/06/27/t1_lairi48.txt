I would be glad to be proven wrong, but full decentralization is a myth, because to inherent structural issues.

Projects usually have a team responsible for development and making decisions, which creates a layer of centralization.

Even if full decentralization were achievable, it would ruin a project. At least in terms of efficiency. Problems like lack of coordination, poor synergy, slow progress, and inefficient communication would come up.

Without a team or clear leadership, project development would stall, making it difficult to address challenges, scale, and innovate of develop with efficiency.
