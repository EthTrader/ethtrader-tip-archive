It's definitely gonna lose all those  "shrimp" accounts that only make a handful of comments on trending posts. I rarely see people tip users with less than 1000 contrib.

Even earlier, I saw 1 person post something, an unregular and a regular both reply with similar sentiment, and the regular got a tip, the unregular didn't xD
