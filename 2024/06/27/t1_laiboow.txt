Look back at all the comments about how good we thought Arbitrum was going to be.. there were hundreds of comments saying Donut to 1 dollar, easy 10x, huge volume incoming, new members will flock in and then a cex will have to list.

  
the reality was users plummeted, partly because there were so many cheaters and liars, the price is down 50%, there is no volume and no way to get any and obviously no plausible path to a cex listing for lots of genuine reasons.

After taking several Ls like that we should be reluctant to keep making predictions and more reluctant to believe the sorts of predictions or expectations people have, they are too rarely unbias or correct to be trusted. 

  
The market is correct and it's quite ballsy to say that the market got this one wrong, it's valued fairly considering how small this community has become after so many people left and all that arguing and drama going on all the time.
