Gut feeling is posts won't become that much higher. While no unregistered upvotes will count, no downvotes will count either.

Quite often I'd get 10-15 tips, but my upvotes would be around 6-9.

Less people posting though, so it seems unlikely to become lower, but I don't think it'll be drastically higher either.

Gonna be interesting to see it revealed!
