My prediction, the users at the top won't particularly change much.

Far more users won't earn anything. So many users Over 400 of the 512 users actually made less than 100 comments.

Guaranteed, those users aren't 'well known' enough and likely won't earn any tips.

I think there will be less than 250 users on the next CSV - this isn't just eliminating alt-accounts, but eliminating the irregular users who don't spend all day every day here xD
