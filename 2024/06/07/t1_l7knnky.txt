I give more than I get, already checked!.

We have old users who only expect to receive without giving. I brought this to my attention many times even before the new rules were implemented.

We will remain 30-40 users who give each other upvotes.

This system is a disaster and I don't know how this is not visible. There is nothing to wait for!
