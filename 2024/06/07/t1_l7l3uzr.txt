i don't think that the ecb rate has much effect on the crypto market eu after the wars n ukraine & the middle east is struggling to grow even a little and to control inflation, canada, australia, korea r doing v.good but they aren't big enough to make a big effect on the cypto market, on the other hand the us is big enough to make such an effect f it could lower the rate, any way eth now at 3680k & hope things won't get worse
