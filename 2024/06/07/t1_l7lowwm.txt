I think the move to tip2vote is actually bearish for the growth of the token

It's great to reduce downvote manipulation but i think it's going to hinder new users joining the space - more donuts going to be disturbed to less users isn't strictly a good thing

I've already been swapping my liquidity pool rewards into moons. Much brighter future there
