Yup, I'm not a fan at all. I'm probably going to earn more DONUT's personally with these changes, but at what cost?  I think it's going to hinder DONUT's growth going forward - and that's the big picture.

The intent is good, no doubt about it, but the result merely eliminates downvote manipulation, and adds other issues.
