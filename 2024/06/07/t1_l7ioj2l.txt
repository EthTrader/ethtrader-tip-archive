If i'm living off my stake reward, I would consider selling my ETH when i'm like 60 - if I make it that far - that lump sum I would no longer need the stake rewards for the remainder of my years.

Or, I don't sell, but write my ETH into my will for that cute blonde across the road who I will pay to be my maid.
