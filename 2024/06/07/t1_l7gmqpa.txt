MEXC I can see doing this but Coinbase and Binance have higher standards. The way I see it is that these coins are funded by rich people and the websites are meant to look shitty to keep the meme coin image. Like Bonk. That one had ties to SBF. 

As far as people getting left holding the bag. That can happen with any crypto. Lots of people get left holding bags by people who sell them the diamond hands mentality.

Crypto is volatile and meme coins are even more volatile. Treat meme coins like a casino.
