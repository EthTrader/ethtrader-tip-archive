>if not, there is always one next year

well, not really! I have already everything booked ðŸ˜…

>Any advice how to avoid that injury?

well, pubalgia seems like to be still a king of mystery... for sure it can be caused with very intense training if your running technique is not good!

I thought I had it good, since I trained that a lot, but it turned out I hate some sort of muscles asymmetry on the abdomen and that could have been the reason why

so yeah, I think with very high and intense training it can happen... I was training several marathons plus adding a lot of mileage to try an ultra marathon one day... so I was running something like 100/120 miles per week, plus some hiking and a lot of walking ðŸ¥´
