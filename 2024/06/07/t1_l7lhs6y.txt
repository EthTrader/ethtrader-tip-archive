I think that risk management is, without a doubt, the most important and common aspect of trading, doesn’t matter the market. The main concept is to never risk more than you can afford to lose. It’s a cliche, but that’s the truth.

I often say that risk management isn’t a strategy, it’s a mindset. Preserving capital is as important as winning.
