Yea, you're right. But don't hate the player, hate the game.

You can't blame companies for wanting to make money. That's the whole purpose of a business, to generate revenue and scale. The problem is that these businesses often try to earn income through unethical means. I know what I'm talking about, because my field is finance.

It's true that crypto is losing the concept of utility to hype. Hype is what moves the markets, speculation. Everyone is after profit, and honestly anyone who says they aren't is lying. Most people don't care about decentralization, smart contracts, blockchain tech, etc.

I make a living trading, so naturally I'm going to chase the hype like everyone else.
