An extra 50k DONUT per round should be added,. bringing the total reward allocation up to 150k DONUT.

Not sure when this will be added, whether it's after the Distro is signed off, or if we have to wait 17 days for the next Rewards Allocation via Sushi..com platform

perhaps u/Friendly-Airline2426 or u/Mattg1981 might have a clear answer :D
