>I place less value on liquidity providers than you.

One thing liquidity providers do have is Proof of ETH - a concept you were toying with the idea for.

It's hard to weigh one over the other, both are necessary. We do need liquidity to be provided if we want outsiders to be able to buy/burn DONUT for any reason, such as advertising, or any other future utility we might develop. 

I also like the idea of contests,  and rewarding actual effort, as opposed to mindlessly spending all day commenting in the daily. Even with tip2vote, the system just favours those who tip each other the most, regardless of what content produced.

Contests require people to put in some effort, thought or ideas, or share knowledgeable understanding in order to be rewarded.
