They're constantly working, r/CryptoCurrency's team never stops. The fact that they did not give up on Moons even after what Reddit did, shows their caliber. Also, they're bringing distributions back.

Then, of course, the tokenomics. We're talking about a hard capped, fully deflationary token without ownership. NO ONE controls the smart contract.

Also please note that I'm not affiliated with r/CryptoCurrency in any regard, just stating the facts! I've got friends there, that's it.
