Honestly, it's an absolute fucking shitshow and in 1 day has proven it will be a complete and utter faiilure.

The intent is to make voting transparent, and reward good quality content, that is simmply not going to happen. It's just going to be a popularity content between which users tip each other the most no matter what the content. 

This is no way going to improve rewarding quality content at all, in fact, it will make it harder for irregular users to get a tip, because they don't have a "tipping reputation" 

After only 1 day, we can already see which users give the TIP1 to any comment, skewed moreso towards users they are friendlier with. 

The intent behind Tip2Vote for comments is fair, but the system has a 0% chance of being a better system.

The only thing this will achieve is driving genuine contributors away even faster than the upvote based rewards system.
