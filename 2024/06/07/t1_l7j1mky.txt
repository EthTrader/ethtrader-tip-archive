MOON hit a new ATH earlier this year, hitting 60c, thats 10c higher than when they were listed on Kraken!

Currently has found a stable range between 20-21c - but Moon distros are only about 1 month away from resuming and they still continue to have an ongoing queue of sponsors renting the banner and hosting AMA's.

New ATH this year, I believe.
