The MOON token is definitely in a more bullish position. It's kind of amusing how much blatant moon farming gets downvoted now, but genuine discussion is still getting upvoted. I think the period of having no moon rewards has changed peoples sentiment of what content actually provides value to the sub. Definitely a good thing!
