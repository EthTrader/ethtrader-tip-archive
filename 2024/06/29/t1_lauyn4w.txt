I don't see that's clarified how much more donuts I need to have higher voting power

What if I have just 10 donuts more then Contrib, do I still get 25%

I think we could make it if the user have more then 2x donut then Contrib, he can get 25%

Till it's not clarified I [ABSTAIN]

But definitely great idea, one more reason to buy donuts!
