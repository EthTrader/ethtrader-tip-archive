Theres r/cryptocurrency for general crypto discussion, we shouldnt change the identity of the sub to "pump our token". 

One problem is, so many users came to this sub after getting banned for cheating/spamming too much in r/cyrptocurrency  - that's no reason to change the foundation of EthTrader to become a general crypto sub, we wouldn't turn this sub into a Movie discussion sub just to reach a new demographic.
