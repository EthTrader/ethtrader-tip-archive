To attract more users we need to be more active promoting Ethtrader to other Reddit communities. I don't mean going to another community and brigading but by doing approved events instead 

I suggested the other day we could reach out to r/ConeHeads and see if they would allow Donut to be earned through posts on there for a limited time. We could use donuts from the treasury but I'd be happy to donate some as well

All it would take is mods reaching out to their mods and coming to some sort of arrangement. We could try other similar events with different communities, we could rent the cc banner, we could do events on twitter

Plenty of ways to grow the user base brother ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›
