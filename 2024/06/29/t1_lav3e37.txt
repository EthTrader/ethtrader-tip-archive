This is only fine if there's a limit cap enforced to how much additional contrib a user can gain. I wouldn't support it if a user can buy more than 10K CONTRIB.

10K is the only reason because it will bring a new user near to making his vote to weight of 1 for T2V.

As Airline mentioned, a big whale can easily buy a million Donut and get 250K contrib without any major efforts towards the community. CONTRIB should always remain something that represents your time and effort spent on the sub rather than what can be bought.

[NO] from me till there's some cap to the proposed CONTRIB.
