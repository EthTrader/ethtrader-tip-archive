\[NO or ABSTAIN\] Not sure if I am not seeing it or I seeing one problem. What exact calculation is going to be made to make equivalent the difference between DONUT amount? For example someone with 100000 CONTRIB and 100000 DONUT will have to buy 25K DONUT to have that 25% extra power while someone with 1000 CONTRIB and 1000 DONUT only needs to buy 250.

Also I think this goes against the CONTRIB principles. I think it is better to reward CONTRIB with contests or other kind of sub activities rather than giving the chance of buying some power.
