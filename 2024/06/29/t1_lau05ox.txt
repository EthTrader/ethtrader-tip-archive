>be too many people and not worth it

Thats the good thing, if its not worth spamming all day just for a few pennies, then you're left with people who are genuinely contributing helpful or discussion.

Theres a couple of users in r/cc that provides good insights into some trading opportunities. That's worth more than a couple of moons ever would be xD
