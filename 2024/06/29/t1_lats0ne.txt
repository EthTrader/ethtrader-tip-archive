I agree it won't move the needle much but its a start!

Airline has been working hard and got a us the ARB grant and I believe Celer bridge soon. He can't do it alone it though! 

u/Friendly-Airline2426 What do you think about the r/coneheads suggestion? If you think its a good idea you could speak with u/ConeDesk and see what would be required from us for it to be implemented as a Donut/ethtrader promotion and then make a proposal for it
