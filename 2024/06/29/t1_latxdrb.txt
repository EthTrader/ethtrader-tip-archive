This. The daily has just as much authentic comments now as it did when it was getting 3k-5k comments a day.

I'd honestly say the r/cc daily, which gets less than 400 comments a day, has more genuine engagement then our daily.

It's a shame we've got less active people, but it's good that people realise they don't need to blanket spam hundreds of comments a day either.
