I agree that is a bit tricky, but so we get one more reason to buy donuts,

My problem with the GP is it's not clarified how much donuts I need to get 25% government power

My idea would be 

If the user have more then 2x donuts then Contrib, he can get the 25%

So if I have 100k contribution, I would need 200k donuts to get the additional 25%
