It’s either a no or abstain from me, as this goes against the core principle of governance weight, which is it can’t be bought. And this is coming from someone who holds a million or two in DONUT.

>For example, a new user would need to purchase $160,000 USD worth of DONUT at current price to have the same governance weight as Aminok assuming the price of DONUT doesn't move with that buy.

We shouldn’t underestimate people. We’ve had  “dangerous” users here before, with that kind of capital. What if they were able to change the outcome of important polls, with their twisted principles?

I think this does more harm than good, as it opens room to DAO attacks.
