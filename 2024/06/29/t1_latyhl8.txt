I'd say the good dialog is not much different as it used to be, we just don't have the thousands of noisy comments we used to have. I'd say this is a good change, but what is alarming is just how few active users there are.

I'd rather see 100 users make 10 comments a day then 10 users make 100 comments a day - providing they are actually different people xD

I think we're entering a shift where people are starting to realize, you don't need to carpet bomb the sub with comments of no substance.

It's not a perfect situation of course, as we really are a sub with less than 50 frequent users, but I'm finding this month there has been a lot more room for actual discussion.
