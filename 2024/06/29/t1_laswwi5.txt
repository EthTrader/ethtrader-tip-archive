The main premise of this proposal is fund management, which is what I’m good at as well.

All these details you mentioned would be up to the organizer. Whether the contests happen on a weekly basis, every other week, or once a month, that would also be up to the organizer. And I agree, they should have some flexibility to “move freely”.

The allocation would be fixed, 50K, it would be up to the organizer to manage them during the distribution round as they see fit.

I would vouch for you for that position, at least for a while.
