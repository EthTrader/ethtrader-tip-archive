Im not sure Buzz. Only few issuers at the top are making good money with BTC ETF

Ark pulled out of Ethereum ETFs because they expect to have 1/3 of the inflows of BTC ones. If that happens to be true, Solana will have even less inflows than Ethereum. They wont bother, also there is a question about Solana security status...

Either way, i think only BTC and ETH can have good inflows in those ETFs.
