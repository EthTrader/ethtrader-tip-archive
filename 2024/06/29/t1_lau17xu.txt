I still see a good future for the sub. But we have to be realistic, DONUT itself is not going to be a $1 token, and, it's not going to be a 10c token either. But that doesn't mean the sub itself can't provide value.

I've read comments from OG users that don't come here anymore due to the donut farming - It'd be good to get back to the core values of what EthTrader really was about.
