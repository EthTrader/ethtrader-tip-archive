Organizing fair and interesting contests does take up some time; I can tell you I put several hours into creating some of the concepts and writing up some of the rules - not to mention making myself available at specific time points to set up the voting process on those days.

25k is overkill for an ongoing role, as Airline mentioned - and, had I written up this proposal, 10k would have been my nominated amount as well.
