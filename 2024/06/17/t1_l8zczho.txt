As crypto was in planing,there wasn't any plans for stables, and I still think crypto can without them

Most of them are just printing money like the fiat and most of them are not stable, look at the algorithmic stables (just a joke like terra), look at tether and their transparency

Most of the value are some papers ðŸ˜‚

So I don't agre with you ser, stables are not essential and they don't provide anything 

We don't need stable in crypto
