I'll be holding my airdrop until the real bull run commences. It's a new token, will have new hype. Despite any "anger" by airdrop farmers who felt short done by, the network itself is still great. Some projects will move on, new projects will arrive.

If the token drops below 20c, I'll even buy more.
