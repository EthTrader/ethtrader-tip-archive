Thanks for the tip!

I miss the fact gnosis rewards were twice as much 

I don't miss having to interact with the staking contract separately - only need to interact with Sushi.com directly 

I think I prefer the ETH pairing as well over a stablecoin pair... but I don't know which would be better performing
