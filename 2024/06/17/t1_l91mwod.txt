sometimes, some other times is just crazy people....

I know one collector that manages to buy every single avatar from gen 1 to gen 3, for a total of 400k use ðŸ‘€

that collection might be worth 100k now, be he's not selling, he just enjoy having it....

I have no idea how many money one should have to buy that stuff at that price, but sometimes I m envious xD
