I've only made ONE mistake.

Going balls deep into Harmony ONE - it was actually my 3rd biggest asset at one stage...

I started at a nice entry point, but iinstead of DCAing out, like a smart person, I FOMO'd in when it was pumping... I even stopped my BTC and ETH DCA to get more ONE....

Took me over 2 years to recover from this noobness...

I'd tip you 1 ONE if I could xD
