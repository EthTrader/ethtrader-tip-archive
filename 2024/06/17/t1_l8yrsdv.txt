lol, well kinda....

I was pisses at this sub so I withdrew my donut LP position and I wanted to find some other juicy LP. I found some interesting ones on scroll so I tried to bridge my funds, but then I apparently couldn't join the LPs for some issues (I have used some shady service called like Dino or something), so I lost my patience and joined the BitCone LP eventually. But the malicious signature happened somewhere while trying to bridging in/away the funds from scroll
