I'm sure we got some hidden talent lurking in this sub!

It's been a long time since I last did anything like this - but I have used **Audacity** in the past for Audio recording, cropping and editing and **OBS** for recording the video.

I have used **Capcut** and **MovAvi** quite some time ago as well.

Phones/Tablets tend to have filters and simple editing tool as default apps now too - if you happen to decide to use real life recording. (Don't dox your face)

Of course, none of us are expecting a million dollar quality ad  xD

I was never the most passionate or the best at graphic design or photoshop, but those apps I used were simple enough for me to wrap my head around and create some things good enough for school assignments!
