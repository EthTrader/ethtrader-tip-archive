Stablecoins are essential, because they provide a reliable medium of exchange and store of value. They reduce the high volatility, which is associated with other coins.

They facilitate smoother transactions, help increase market liquidity, and, above all, serve as a bridge between fiat and crypto in my opinion. Stablecoins help build market trust.
