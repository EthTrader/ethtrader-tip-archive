There's a possibility of price jump in this scenario:

The game is addictive, and it costs MAVIA tokens to upgrade bases or speed up repairs. If players are addicted, they won't sell tokens. Whales will buy more.

(It's a base-building, attacking, looting and repairing kind of game, War Commander kind of.)
