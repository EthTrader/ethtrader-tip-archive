True that. However, it got to the top 100 in the first place off hype.

ARB token unlocks give me same vibes... I wouldnt be surprised if it hits $4 or even $5 in the bull run... I wouldn't be surprised to see it drop down to 30cents when the bear comes.

ALGO continues to increase despite token unlocks and VC sales when the market was aurphoric.

It's a risky game either way!
