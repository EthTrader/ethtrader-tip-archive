No that would take a crap ton of confidence. I have my own strategy which I started 3 years ago it consists of DCA every single day. $10 on ETH after breakfast. Been doing this without skipping a day and its my favorite routine. I will keep doing it until probably 4000-4500 after which I start doing the reverse process which is DCA out. I may keep some ETH to see if it goes to 10k and if it does I will sell everything. Then I would repeat everything after it dips again or if it dips. For reference I am already in profit probably 50%. Dont even bother looking at it if Im being honest !tip 1
