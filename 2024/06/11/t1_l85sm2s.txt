You are an old user here and smarter than me. You know very well that what we accepted is 100% wrong!

Daily's function used to be absolutely anyone could participate and get rewarded for it.

Posts section was for serious and advanced users.

Now I see no difference between the two sections.

However, I see a similarity...Only whales, users with over 20,000 donuts and friendly circles benefit.

I'm sorry but this is not crypto but complete centralization and pushing away the new users we need to move forward.
