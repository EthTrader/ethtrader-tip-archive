Edit: That is what I suggested in the daily 2 days ago, but u/aminok denied it, because it could push alt accounts. But it would be more fair in my opinion. We could see some upvote ring due the new system then. ItÂ´s all open and more fair for older users over 20k governance. A win-win, but we have to take a look with upvote rings then. !tip 1
