>Also, not trying to target anyone in specific, but those who are voting no are the ones who rely on link spamming to earn… is this what we want to reward here?

Given the feedback, for the sake of passing, I will definitely exclude the news multiplier adjustment in this poll. That way we can atleast restore some balance of comedy posts being submitted again.

>Unless we fiddle with the multipliers, this sub’s reward system will always benefit those who put more quantity than quality in terms of content.

This no doubt, the top earners are, and will remain those who post links, and spam tip 1 without much other substance in other posts. Funnily enough, there are lots of complaints that they had to pay donuts for posting duplicate posts, suggesting they arn't spending much effort looking whats already posted, or reading their own article before posting.

I still believe x0.75 is a fair re-balance, majority of news links easily surpass 3.33 tips - but that might need to come with a separate proposal rather than combined change.

Thanks for your feedback!
