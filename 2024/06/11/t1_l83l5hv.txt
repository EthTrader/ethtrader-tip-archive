I’m not sure I made that much sense. But I’m saying I’ll be fine if nothing ever happens. Well in that case I’ll have a couple K€ from having fun on Reddit. I didn’t invest fiat so I’m fine with taking more of a gamble approach. If my stash reaches a pretty significant amount of money one day, I’ll for sure sell.

What’s your strategy? And thanks ![img](emote|t5_37jgj|32634)
