I will admit I have been really disappointed with DONUT. 

I thought that with DONUT being one of the decentralized survivors from Ruggit would make it attractive to former MOONbois and would lead to a spike in exposure and therefore price. That didn't happen.

I thought that with the Reddit IPO, it would generate more interest in RCCs, with DONUT being the undervalued OG just waiting to be discovered. That didn't happen.

I thought with DONUT being listed on Sushi, it would create more exposure and bring in new users and a gradual increase in price. That didn't happen.

So despite all these bullish events happening, DONUT is still toiling mostly in obscurity and the price today is the same as it was on August 19th of last year. Yes, there has been some spikes and dips meanwhile, but the fact remains DONUT has been running in neutral for almost a year now. None of the "big events" have had any sustained upward impact on DONUT's price.

So I don't know. As I've said before, I'm a lot less enthusiastic about DONUT than I used to be. I really went all-in on trying to help DONUT grow, since I created an approved GIPHY account (which apparently is hard to do) as well as making numerous social media GIFs related to DONUT. The GIPHY page has almost 180m views, but that hasn't translated into any new DONUT HODLers.

I also have not made any new DONUT gifs for weeks now, because like I said, I've been really disappointed with it. I spent a lot of time and effort on it and have nothing to show for it. I'll keep the GIPHY page up because it doesn't cost me anything, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be adding much to it going forward.

Oh, and because of some snafu with Reddit, I lost my old Reddit account, and since CONTRIB can't be transferred, I lost all that too. So that's another thing that's significantly dampened my enthusiasm for DONUT.
