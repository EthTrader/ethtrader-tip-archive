I don't really use Cardano at all, except for Staking the bag I bought wayyyy back. However, the staking mechanics for ADA are excellent, and would be a good model to emulate.

>Algorand supports staking with no minimum requirement, offering passive income by simply holding ALGO in a wallet.

This is not true anymore, and hasn't been for quite some time! I think about 2 years ago ALGO switched to a governance model, where you had to sign up for governance, commit however many ALGO you wanted, maintain that much ALGO in your wallet for the entire Governance period (quarters) (And yes, ALGO wasn't locked up at all you were free to transfer it, but doing so made you ineligible for rewards) And at the end of every 3 month period, you received your governance rewards.

Not a bad system either really.
