>got nuke coz of Post already Posted

Dang man... That's really messed up. They needs to add a bot to automatically let you know about a post that's already posted or deduction of 50% from pay2post that's already posted. Most times, users doesn't know that similar post is posted already and the post got removed after. My post was removed too yesterday after 10hours, saying similar post was already posted and I don't know but still will have to pay for it. 

>rest thanks to shitnuts!! ☺️

Sorry about that and luckily shitnuts doesn't have the power no more. !tip 1
