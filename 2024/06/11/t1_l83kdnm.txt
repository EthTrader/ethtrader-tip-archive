Meh. I’ve never invested fiat in it, I’ll stay active in the community and see how the project evolves. I’m not bullish on donuts but I think there’s still room to grow, as long as the community stays proactive. And I’m seeing some small announcements here and there. So I’lll be holding mine until a price target I’m happy with, hits or I’ll sell if I eventually get tired and lose all confidence in it.

TLDR; Likely holding on for a pretty long time
