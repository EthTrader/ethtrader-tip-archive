Just be sure you flair things appropriately and don't try to game the system.

Someone else made an OC flair, coz they hit 500 words, but it was blatant their post was ChatGPT. It got removed.

Someone else just copied the news articles directly, and that got removed because it was not a "discussion" flair, but should have been a news flair, and then removed because it didn't cite the sources xD
