> Media/Comedy up to 0.5x and Original Memes to 0.75x

That probably gets a little trickier to police and moderate xD

I don't disagree original memes could deserve more love than re-posting old or somebody elses stuff, and cropping out their watermark or tag - I just think that becomes hard work to moderate.

That's probably where if users really appreciate something perhaps they should tip more generously instead?
