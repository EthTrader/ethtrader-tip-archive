I would be voting yes. Honestly, at this pace the top earners will be the ones who spam more links… again.

Reddito’s mistake with the CSV allowed us to learn how different things would be, if links had a 0.1 multiplier, and who would be rewarded and penalized. Naturally, those who spammed more links would’ve earned less, and the ones who created their own content would’ve earned more.

Unless we fiddle with the multipliers, this sub’s reward system will always benefit those who put more quantity than quality in terms of content.

What worries me is that spammers / farmers would change their meta, thus starting to spam Comedy posts. It would hurt meme artists such as myself. Under this new system, it’s not worth it to create original memes, because we need 25 tips to AT LEAST break even. I want to keep my competitive stance within the DAO, therefore I want my governance weight to increase over time. So it doesn’t make sense to me to post memes under such a particular system.

And I’m fine with that, I would rather not do what I do best, but have a cleaner feed, than to buff my favorite flair and have everyone ruining it for everyone else.

Also, not trying to target anyone in specific, but those who are voting no are the ones who rely on link spamming to earn… is this what we want to reward here?
