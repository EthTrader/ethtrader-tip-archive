Well, I think it would be ironic for the Ethereum Foundation to go public with an IPO, and getting involved in the traditional financial world. Eth, and crypto as a whole, is fundamentally designed to disrupt and offer an alternative to the traditional financial system. The core of the whole thing is decentralization, reducing the influence of traditional financial intermediaries, and giving people a peer-to-peer economy.

They'd be stepping into the very realm eth wants to change. It would mean getting into traditional stock markets, and the traditional financial infrastructure that eth aims to move away from.

Every eth bro would hate it.
