I've been writing the article since yesterday without thinking it'll go against the rule. Now I'm about to make the post, I then remembered automod will remove it because there's the word bitcoin. I'll just stick to comments and TIP2VOTE both post and comments. I'm staying away from post for some time. !tip 1
