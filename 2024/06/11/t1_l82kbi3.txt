I don't disagree with the new rules in moderation. It just unfortunate that there isn't an extra mod so things get removed faster. I'd rather have something removed within an hour then 24 hours later xD

I do think users should adapt and become more vigilant before posting any old story. I've gone days without posting anything at all because I search reddit and see the story already posted. So, I've managed to avoid having anything removed.
