To be fair, the previous proposal to Nerf news links from x1.0 to x0.1 only failed by a fraction - about 40k donuts ahead of support I believe.

And I definitely voted no to that as I felt that nerf was way too severe.

But, as I said, this is the gain general sentiment as pre-proposal discussion, and I'm happy to exclude alterations to the news flair in the formal proposal if the majority are in that boat now as well.
