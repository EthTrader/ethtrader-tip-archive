I totally agree! ETH needs to stay updated and improving every month, year and trying to keep breaking records to maintain its leadership. This basically applies to every aspect in life that has more than 1 option. In fact it is human basic to keep engineering to always improve things because there is nothing perfect (only you \*wink\*).

This is why I know that I will never stop having job opportunities as Software engineer. There is always something to fix, improve or create. I am planning in fact applying to crypto jobs in 1-2 years after I have a better economic net.
