I think the idea was to allow approved users to be involved, as a niche perk for having 20k governance. I guess it's also another way too keep EthTraderReposter busy xD

I don't mind the idea of a Panel of judges - when I originally shared with Aminok r/Cryptocurrency Cointest - voting was done by a panel of multiple judges and the winners were the submissions with the highest average scores for each criteria.
