Just a little note here.

Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper and saving less attractive, which can increase the overall liquidity in the market. More liquidity means more money is available for investment. When interest rates are low, traditional safe investments like savings accounts and bonds offer lower returns. This will make investors seek higher returns in riskier assets, like crypto. This can bring more capital into the crypto market.

Also, interest rate cuts can lead to a weaker USD. Crypto, mainly eth and btc, is a hedge against dollar weakness. As the value of the dollar decreases, the value of crypto can increase, as investors look for alternative stores of value.

If the interest rates are lower, it can lead to higher inflation. Once again, crypto is considered as a hedge against inflation due to the limited supply. This would also lead to higher stonk market valuations, as companies can borrow more cheaply to invest and grow. Positive sentiment in stonks sometimes means positive sentiment in crypto.

Crypto is super sensitive to speculation and investor sentiment. News of interest rate cuts can create a bullish sentiment.
