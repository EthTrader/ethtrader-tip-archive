>Whatâ€™s your strategy?

well, I'm a RCC schizophrenicðŸ‘€

I change my strategy around these tokens way too often! 

till not so long ago, I hady position on the LP cause I believed in donut, but I don't think I don't anymore. Plus I'm not even sure I like how the sub is managed atm, but I'll keep farming donuts and maybe swap them for eth/btc from time to time

...til I change my mind again ðŸ¤£
