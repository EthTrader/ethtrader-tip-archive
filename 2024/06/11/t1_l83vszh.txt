The largest Moon whale took (im assuming profits) a couple days ago, dumping over 2 million moons. I believe said whale accumulated a lot of moons back when they were 3-10cents after the sunset crash.

Moon distro's are on track to restart in July, and I'm feeling quite bullish on their future personally.
