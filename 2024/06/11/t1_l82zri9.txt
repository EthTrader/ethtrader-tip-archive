>I'll disagree with that, it's about the sub and restoring a healthier balance of the content published. Currently news links have the overwhelmingly majority of content submissions, and comedy has pretty much come to a halt. 

I'm happy I'm not the only one who feels the same way. Many of us do. That's why I suggested increasing the multiplier for comedy and leaving the news link multiplier alone. The daily comments multiplier has been nerfed, should the posts be next?
I'm not against the balance you're trying to restore. I'm against taking more away from ordinary people like usðŸ˜„ !tip 1
