It's not worth it on it's own, but I guess it's a dual farming effort along with other networks... 

I've received about $15 worth of rewards from them in the form of FOXY, DEGEN and USDC so far... probably spent atleast $15 in gas fees and minting those cubes... 

But, if it means I get more Linea or Scroll with the interactions, thats a win xD
