i think maybe half of mobile games r 2d/2.5d games like card & board games, so maybe pwas works for that type of games, indeed aaa 3d games won't work that way, on chain games r the future and they will aaa games made with unreal engine5 and such, they will b available on playstation and xbox gaming consoles. thanks man have a great day
