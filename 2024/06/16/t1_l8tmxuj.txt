My immediate reaction.

I wonder if we could coordinate with r/cryptocurrency - and utilise a bot to calculate it.

Allocate a small portion of DONUT from the current Post or Comment pool - and distribute DONUT to users who submit posts containing ETHEREUM in the title. I would also suggest only awarding it to the post creators only, not the comments within the post.

That keeps it's relevant to this sub and our subs focus, whilst providing that little bit of exposure, and potentially rewarding new users who produce relevant content.
