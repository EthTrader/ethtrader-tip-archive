They were always a bit behind on the timeline of Renzo and Etherfi as far as I know. But I do like the user experience a lot, they constantly had events up to boost earnings, they also gave something like 100 more EL points per ETH on Scroll for a while and don't had any major PR issues so far as far as I know. 

I think I've read somewhere that the token might come in around 2 months but that's just speculation. For me it's mainly an Eigenlayer + Scroll play but Kelp looks relatively under farmed compared to Renzo and Etherfi so it could be a good bonus. !tip 1
