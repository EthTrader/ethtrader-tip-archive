I'm looking forward to claiming my ZKSync airdrop, even moreso if I get a bonus from Syncswap and Koi.finance as well.

BLAST coming soon is also going to be a nice bonus, given I've probably spent less than $15 in gas fees, and already made more than $30 in rewards from trying gaming and gambling apps.

Linea / Scroll / Etherffi+EigenLayer / Berachain are amongst other i'd expect to get something from.

FRom this point on though, I'm not really actively farming anything anymore - mostly letting passive rewards build up.

Thanks for your ongoing efforts sharing some Alpha!
