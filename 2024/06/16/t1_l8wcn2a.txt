\[YES\] I only ask for one thing. A page with all the blocked websites that will be maintaned and updated.

As far as I know cryptopanic doesn't copy and paste content. They just list links from the original sources without changing the link so there is no way to detect if someone used cryptopanic because the link is the original source.
