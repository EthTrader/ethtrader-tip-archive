This is what I said. The SEC, and the democrats, have been taking an anti-crypto stance for a long time now. They know they might be losing ground to the republicans, and the crypto industry is more inclined towards the republicans.

What they’re doing now is an act of self interest to keep their roles, and to get the votes of crypto investors. ETF trading might even start in the meantime too.

This is the fastest the SEC has ever been. It’s all an agenda.
