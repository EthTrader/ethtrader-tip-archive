>yup, I saw a few other bronuts having their posts brought back after complaining with mods ðŸ« 

That kinda not okay if you'd ask me. When you didn't confirmed a similar post, why removing it in the first place when they know so well people pay2post. At least they needed to confirm before removing a post. But I guess we human aren't perfect btw, they're also trying their best to do exactly what the community votes for in the proposal. It shows they aren't really in love with the rules too. I hope all these changes soon. 

And tipping to votes for comments too is weird. Sometimes I forgot to do so !tip 1
