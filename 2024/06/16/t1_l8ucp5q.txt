I think there should be higher standards in regard to listing new coins on a CEX. It shouldn’t  just be about trading volume or market cap.

It’s not fair that some shitcoin has tons of volume, but zero utility and real development, and still gets listed. While legit projects with less visibility get pushed to the corner.

But then again, companies are here to make money and they do it through fees. Shitcoins give them fees.
