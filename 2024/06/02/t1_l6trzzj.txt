I would be all in for this. I'd also like to add that I agree with u/aminok that any approved user could be allowed to do this and not only 100k gov users since every approved user already has the power to remove posts... So approving them against a super poor reddit filter doesn't have to be guarded behind a 100k governance score imho. But even if we put the 100k rule I'd be for it. Just not sure if it serves a real reason as there will be hardly any abuse with this power imho and the power to remove posts is way higher and already there. 

It does serve as an incentive to get more gov score though haha. 

Thank you for making a follow up on this issue which is particularly important to me. !tip 5
