in my case, that's not even a duplicate post.

look at my UwU post from yesterday, is about the bounty.

the only other post about UwU on the sub is 5 days old and it's about the hack, not the bounty 

I asked aminok to check tagging him in that post and he replied he doesn't know how duplicate post moderation is being handled ðŸ« 

this is the problem, imo

ofc I also agree with you on deleting the duplicate earlier....

out there is pure chaos when it comes to moderation
