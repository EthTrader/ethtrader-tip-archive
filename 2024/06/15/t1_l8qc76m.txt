>And mods could become more proactive in banning cheaters.

Exactly this.... They're users here who caught cheaters and we they can just apply for mods and ban those cheaters. Just like how RCC gave a mods to a female whose work is to catch cheaters and ban them. I think that'll be better than this tbh. This system is really not the best at all but let see how it goes after this round. I just feel for reddito that'll calculate the karma. Man it won't be easy for him and his website isn't even really working well this round as well. !tip 1
