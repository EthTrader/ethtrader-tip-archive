Completely stupid. the same thing always happened for months here, ever since donuts launched… it’s only now that upvotes are ”public” that people are freaking out about it.

Meanwhile behaviour hasn’t changed, its just simple reddit ethiquette. Let me repeat, people were fine doing this for years when having a convo, why is it now such an issue? Doesn’t make sense.
