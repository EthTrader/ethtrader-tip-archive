- paid 15% of my mortgage with SHIB profits in 2021 (but I could have paid almost 50% if I had sold at the right time lmao)

- sold my moons and bricks at the right time before reddit screwed up with us

- rebought moons for a lower price and sold them again when they went up. Then bought again 1/4 of my original stash just with swing trade profits, currently holding

- used the money I made with moons for 2 things: 80% to buy bonds and now I have an emergency fund equivalent to 2 years of household spending; and the rest to give my wife a sabbatical year (all 2024) while she makes a career change
