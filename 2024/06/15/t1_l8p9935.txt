Depends on us tbh. I'm totally up for building a user-funded community treasury, lets say of 50k to 100k donuts, and airdrop all of them to one or more of the following categories of wallets:

- memecoin holders in Arbitrum
- top addresses in Activity
- top Sushi users

We could easily airdrop 1 or 2 donuts to each address. That's how we could get some more recognition, but being in social media would be more than necessary to have a good communication about it. Lots of stagnant projects have been riding the market well after having airdropped to a more general userbase. Just my 2c
