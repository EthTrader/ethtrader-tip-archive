I needed something to mine with my GPUs back in ‘22.. KAS was new and profitable.. 

Now it’s entering the top-25 without a single tier-1 CEX having it listed..

It’s fast, cheap, fair launched and now KRC-20 has been announced for this or next month to release.

What means smart contracts, tokens and stablecoins on their network.

‘Rust’ upgrade has been implemented, what means 10 BPS (blocks per second).

Testnet is running at 100BPS. So ultrafast, with hardly any fees..
