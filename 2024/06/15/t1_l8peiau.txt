I'm not sure tbh. It definitely improves quality and puts more responsibility on the poster to check it's not been posted before hand.

On the other hand sometimes it's hard to see if it's already posted. I've had some removed that I was sure wasn't posted and have then gone searching for the post that was before me. Found it with a different title but the content was the same so technically duplicate content. None of us have time to go and read every single post in case it had a different title.

Another issue with the duplicate content is Reddit filters. Someone could make a Reddit filtered post and be waiting for approval and because it's not on the feed someone else then does the same not knowing it's already in the que.

Maybe we could address the Reddit filter issue and pay2post and leave duplicate content as it is?

I must say that Reddit filtered posts are getting approved a lot faster recently though so thanks for the speedy approvals!
