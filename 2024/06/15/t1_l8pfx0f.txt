I don't know a thing about bot development or coding;

Would it not be easier just to get Distributed Moderation  to approve filtered posts functional?

Otherwise if it was possible to give bots a "priority order"

Currently;

1) Pay2Post is charged (Regardless if filtered or not)
2) Donut-Bot stickies comment for Tip confirmations
3) Donut-Bot deletes/locks post if posted within 30 minutes of previous post, or exceeds 24 hour post cap.


Is it possible to switch the order of 1 and 2?
