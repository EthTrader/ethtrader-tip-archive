Most recently I saw a user Tip someone elses post regarding a certain topic.

And then later that day, posted the same story.

And then complained their post was removed.

They obviously didn't pay much attention to what they were tipping, or posting - so yes, this would just get worse if Pay2Post was removed.

Additionally, if no Pay2Post and no Duplicates, if I can't find a new story to post, i'll just post a shitty youtube video, low quality meme or Tweet from X/Twitter - coz even 1 tip is "profit" xD
