It’s a good rule in itself, but it requires more consistency and  from the mods’ side. Many a times mods have removed posts that later turned out to be not duplicates. Now it sometimes happens that content is removed simply on the basis of a word in the title. u/rikbona had a good example in what happened to him. Here’s the quote

”in my case, that's not even a duplicate post.

look at my UwU post from yesterday, is about the **bounty.**

the only other post about UwU on the sub is 5 days old and it's about the **hack, not the bounty**

Also, I would like better transparency from the mods. Everytime a post is removed, the mods should insert a link to what was the original post.

All in all, the rule is good, but the mods could improve with transparency and consistence
