Tbh I can understand Aminoks point but I disagree with it. We already have 0.5x in the daily and people are getting less upvotes. Comments in the daily used to get 5+ updoots regularly but they don't often get tipped that many times at all now

Completely agree it will be off putting for new users coming in here and being like what the hell is going on lol
