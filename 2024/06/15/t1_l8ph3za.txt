These crypto media websites are making articles about random people on X. More specifically, about their tweets.

I’m curious what exactly makes them “analysts”. Are they advertising themselves? Or is the crypto media out of content?

It’s just random numbers being thrown around, and none of these people know what they’re talking about. I know this, because I’m a crypto analyst!
