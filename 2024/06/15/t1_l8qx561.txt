>They worry that a lot of crypto projects are risky or scams, and they want to make sure people don't get ripped off. They aren't necessarily against crypto, but they want it to fit within the existing regulatory framework to ensure it's safe and fair for investors.Â 

The SEC is against crypto because they do not like to not have full control about everything. It is also a thread against their status quo because crypto reduces USD power giving a chance to countries under USD chains to adopt another currency.

If they were really worried about crypto scams and risky projects they would stop attacking good projects like ETH and focus on controlling memecoins and shitcoins and prosecuting the people and influencers involved with it.
