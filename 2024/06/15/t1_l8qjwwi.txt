I'm going to quote my reply to DBRiMatt


>I knew about crypto before RCPs but spend much time on game and meme sub and spend some amount of money on Reddit avatar. I comments lots and made some post on the Fortnite sub which resulted me in receiving bricks at that time. I received DMs from people telling me to trade my bricks with vbucks which got me curious what was it all about. To cut the story short, I pay for my house rent with the bricks at that time and join RCC afterwards then Reddit sunset their stuff. But still thanks to Reddit, I was able to pay my house rent just by making comments on the internet. It's really unbelievableÂ
