Ok cool I was just wondering. Don't think I'm a fan of this tbh 

People would be upvoting each other every single time they reply and will essentially be forced to upvote to have a conversation. I think it goes against your point about wanting quality content being upvoted as well tbh

I could be having an argument with someone and each time me and the other user replied to each other we would be upvoting each other xD
