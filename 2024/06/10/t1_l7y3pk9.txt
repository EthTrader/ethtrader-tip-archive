This is the answer to why there are no new users.

We removed the alternate accounts, but now we have a huge problem with attracting new people. It's just that most old users won't interact with them. Some don't even want to interact with the established ones they know very well because they have to pay.

It's a closed circle!

Someone convince me with arguments to the contrary, if possible please?
