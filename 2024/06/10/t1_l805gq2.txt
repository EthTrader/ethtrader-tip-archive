Eth is kept cold, for receipt only. The seed is stored in two different physical locations and protected with an additional password! It is also diversified into two different wallets.

I sign smart contracts for other coins with the regular set of accounts because Ledger security is still better than a hot wallet.

I've looked at multisig but didn't like it. Also, it's very expensive.
