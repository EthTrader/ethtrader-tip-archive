My take on MATIC is that it’s a great asset to invest in the longer run, because of its price stability. That way, holders can benefit from passive income, by staking it on chain.

But because its price is too stable, it sucks for us traders. I wouldn’t touch it because it’s just going to force me to hold it, thus stalling my bankroll.
