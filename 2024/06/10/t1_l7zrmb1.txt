Historically, market sentiment brings volatility around elections. I believe ETH will pump see a pump if the market anticipates favorable policies.

I have a theory regarding global economic status and who rules in those times. I think the economy use to be good while right wings are on charge and then when everything goes to shit left wings rule. Meaning that during those years right wing destroys and then left wing tries to fix it. At least that is what happens in Spain xD
