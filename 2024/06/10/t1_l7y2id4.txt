I think it’s going to be a crabby summer, which is actually good for eth in a way. This is because there’s no selling pressure to cause a big dip.

The $3K level has been achieved and I doubt it’ll drop below that any time soon.

I think what’s going to cause the next big pump is market sentiment, more specifically the kickstart of the ETF trading.
