Yes and no.

I guess people use this new system in different ways. I just use it the same way I always did with upvotes so Iâ€™ll likely tip back. But it does happen that I forget it and sometimes when a long convo going back and fourth I may not tip towards the end of it. 

But yeah it can be annoying!
