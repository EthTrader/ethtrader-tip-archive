I have a hard wallet, but it's lying somewhere, and I don't even remember where. I've never connected it to any sites. I usually transfer assets from a CEX to my main wallet, which I intend to hold for a long time.

I have a few other wallets for holding Donuts and other tokens that I like to trade more frequently.

Not clicking on links and checking multiple times before connecting to any new site has kept my wallets pretty safe so far. Also, revoking token spending and contracts from time to time helps a lot.
