The now deleted video showed the Normie character hanging itself, being buried in a cemetery, and then meeting a God-like figure. The deity tells Normie that they need to refund the community and relaunch to return to Earth. Then, the character jumps from their grave with news reports stating, “Death is not a problem.”

**Gross.**
