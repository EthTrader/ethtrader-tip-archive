Very true.

I'm consideirng myself very lucky with ZKSync airdorp, for me it was about 3 times larger than my ARB airdrop (ARB was amazing, no intent to farm, a complete surprise for naturally using the network)

I think I was lucky with ZKSync, I did actively farm it, but I also didn't go stupid and waste hundreds of dollars on GAS interacting with every single dapp I could find, nor did I waste time interacting with it every day of the week.

I know others are angry or disappointed, but, I my approach seemed to reward me quite lucratively for what I did.
