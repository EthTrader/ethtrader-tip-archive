I think 3 is a good balance. I'd say some people just need realise that you don't *need* to post 3 links every single day, it's okay to only post 1 or 2, of even none xD

Hopefully with distributed moderation there are now less duplicates being posted. I think people just need to spend a couple of minutes actually reading their article, and searching the sub before posting. Especially when an article is actually about non-eth tokens.
