Lol exactly, people seem to forget Binance is the top CEX in the market. They're worth billions. Binance has been under FUD for years and they're still at the top. I'm not trying to defend them, I personally hate Binance and their customer service and had a terrible experience with them in the past. But facts are facts. !tip 1
