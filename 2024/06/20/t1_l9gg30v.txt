If you don't really plan on trading them, and happy to just let them sit, and having the governance power then theres no harm leaving them on Gnosis.

If you do want to sell them eventually, you probably will always be able to, but  just might find eventually there is less liquidity on honeyswap to trade them, which could mean more slippage depending on how much you want to trade, and how big the pool is.
