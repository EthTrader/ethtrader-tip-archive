>  I wouldn’t even hint at an airdrop being possible,

ARB did it right, 2 years before the airdrop, they said they didn't see a need for a token xD

>I’m really curious what Blast is gonna do in terms of how points and Gold correlate to allocation

I'm hopeful  for BLAST. It might not be the best payout, but it does seem quite transparent. I've heard suggestions that 1 Million points might be worth like $20 or so - but who knows.

I imagine this airdrop will favour influencers and whales with high volume and hiigh referral numbers, but if there is a cap to earnings, or weighted tiers, and it's really just Points+Gold considerations - then it could be quite a fair airdrop to receive.

Good luck
