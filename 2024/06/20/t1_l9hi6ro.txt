Yea MATIC is not it, gang.

It lacks the volatility and short-term fluctuations, which is important for traders. I cashed out recently and only brought like 5% profit home. It's better than nothing, certainly better than losing.

Though, Polygon is great and it's definitely a leader in the market. I'd recommend DCAing and staking. It's a long-term play, in my opinion. Definitely not for me.
