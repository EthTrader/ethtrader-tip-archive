**TLDR;** Italy is introducing a draft decree to "enhance crypto asset surveillance" and impose severe penalties for market manipulation and insider trading. So far so good on the latter.

The decree is most likely being approved soon. There will be fines, ranging from $5,400 to $5.4 million.

So this is the usual customer protection, financial stability, proper market function type of thing. My concern is that there's a very thin line between surveillance and control. Meaning privacy stands in the middle.
