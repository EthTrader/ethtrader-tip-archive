The Fetch.ai team initially developed the FET utility token on an ERC-20 contract on the Ethereum network while finishing the work on the Fetch.ai native main network (Main-net). This helped developers across the world get their hands on the FET tokens earlier and kickstart the process of developing innovative solutions within the Fetch.ai ecosystem. 

FET, as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum contract has never been Fetch.ai's end game because the Ethereum chain does not offer the degree of scalability needed by the kinds of applications the Fetch.ai ecosystem aims for.
