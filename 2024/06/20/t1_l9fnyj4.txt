It is a really tricky rule and I understand applying it to really clear duplicated topics/news but still tricky.

Regarding user created content, I think it is trickier and should only remove content that is exactly or really close to the real news (still not sure about this) but if someone talks about the same topic applying a different point of view, etc. it shouldn't be removed.

From what other users told me and how myself feel when I share/create content right now, I feel like there is a lot of uncertainty and feels like a wall.

Some different users have told me things like "this is unbearable", "sub is so boring", "I dont feel like going there anymore", etc in the coming days. Just telling you this because well, those users have been there for at least 1 year or more and I am starting to feel the same way. I am quite worried about the activity of the sub. We are now all humans but we need to find a way to bring more human beings to the sub xD

Sorry for the unstructured long comment.
