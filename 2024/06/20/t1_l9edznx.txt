I'm still bagholding a bunch of alts I don't want to talk about

They've just been laying dormant, staking for a couple of years, so I'm still hopeful it'll pay off - nothing wrong with a little sunk cost fallacy xD

I've got the full range - from BTC, ETH, L2 alts, memecoins, microcaps.

My intention is to use the next euphoric bull run to switch into BTC/ETH only - and then use alts/memecoins as very short term swing trading gambits.
