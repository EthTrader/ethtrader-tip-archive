Agreed. The whole point of posts is to encourage discussion in the first place

Would we want to create a culture where *only* the first person to repost the links gets ‘rewarded’? And no other discussion on something can take place, everything else must be silenced once a news repost without any text is posted?

I can understand if multiple news posting the same thing is removed, but it will get really ridiculous if nobody can post any original content or idea on the same topic once a news article is posted.
