2nd fyi - tagging more than 3 users in a single comment means they don't receive the notification (reddit anti-spam measure)

my personal opinion is the content adds enough non plagiarized, non-AI content that I would consider it discussion. However, sadly - i think Fred is right - I would simply seek clarification/confirmation about the media format... 

Honestly, I can't even tell the difference as an old.reddit user
