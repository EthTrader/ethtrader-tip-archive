>What is a reasonable amount to charge? Do we burn those donuts or send them to treasury for future contests/dev work?

Depends what perks we end up adding.

If you are doing a seasonal model, I would suggest a base price of 125 DONUT per week. That's 500 per month, or 1000 for 2 months - depending on your season structure.

Or peg it to $1.25 USD per week, thats your $5 a month membership.

>Do we burn those donuts or send them to treasury for future contests/dev work?

I would say burn them - I think we get enough into the Treasury building up each Distro.
