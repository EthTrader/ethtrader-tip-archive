I'm not entirely convinced on that being the perk, the Pay2Post is a great anti-spam measure.

However, such perk would certainly increase the "value" in membership.

28 days per round, up to 3 posts per day - that's potentially 3,696 DONUT being saved in Pay2Post fees based on last rounds ratio... I'd say that would justify atleast a 2000 DONUT per month cost. 

Maybe a 50% discount rather than 100% discount in Pay2Post fees would be more balanced - then keeping the cost at that $5 to $10 range as you said.
