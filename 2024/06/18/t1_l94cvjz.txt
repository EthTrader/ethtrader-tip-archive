>It would be better if the mod removed it,

It's a funny one - personally, I'd only step in if I noticed an article had referral links or clone links to scam sites.

On the other hand, people get just as upset when their post has been removed after 12 hours, because the mods tend to only go through once or twice a day.

Distributed Moderation is an interesting concept when put into practice.
