This was related to a million dollar fraud case which was happened in India where a group of criminals looted money from people showing them dreams and asked them to invest money in their cryptocurrency.

I'm sure that they have paid huge sum to find a loophole in the legal system of India (or bribe to judge?) and twisted the statements. Now judgement will be given in favor of criminals.

Typical Indian judicial system. Easily corruptible.
