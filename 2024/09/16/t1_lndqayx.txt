There will be plenty of users who still comment more than 50 times a day. They just won't be rewarded additional DONUTs from the DAO for doing so.

Maybe people will, instead of commenting on 5 separate SHIB posts, will only comment on one. 

Some people will sit there and keep track of how many comments a day they make, and stop at 50, and others won't give a shit and just use the sub as they normally would, responding to what they feel like responding to.
