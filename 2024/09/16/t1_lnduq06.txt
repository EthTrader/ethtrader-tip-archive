Won't change my habits either.

But, I don't comment on every single post anyway, I tend to avoid US politics posts, and low quality articles about projects I'm not invested in.

WIth any luck, if people are restricting what they comment on, hopefully it means they save their comments for better quality posts.

We certainly don't need the same generic comments like "SHIB gonna have to burn more than that to increase their price" on every single SHIB post xD
