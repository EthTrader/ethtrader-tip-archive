No; there was no "penalty" for over-commenting, there was just "more difficulty" in earning rewards.

Eg, your 55th comment on r/cc would have a -2 "spam" score

This means you need 3 upvotes, to get to 1.

However, in calculations, your spam score would never deduct from your actual score.

This means, if you have 0, 1 or 2 upvotes, your score would be 0. If you got 3 upvotes, your score would be 1.

Eventually comments would start at -25, but this would still never deduct from your earnings, it just meant you weren't making anything from those comments.
