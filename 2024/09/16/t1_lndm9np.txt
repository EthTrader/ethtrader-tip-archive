I am still BULLIEVING 

Just remember, wen we reach 6 cents there will be plenty of people saying we will reach 69 cents

And if we do reach 69 cents there will be plenty saying we will reach $10

How do I know this, because I was there when it happened with Moons (when it was around a cent all the way til it hit 70 cents) - what I mean is that the goalposts will keep shifting

So even though a 10x might seem incredible today, when it actually happens nobody will think much about it and just call for another 10x as the 6 cents will become a totally ‘normal’ price by then
