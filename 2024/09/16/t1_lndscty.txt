Hmm i dont like this negative energy when someone disagree with some proposal , like we are not a cult . no need to insult someone by saying "ahh you are here just of donuts dont you"

like the amount i earned last round wasnt even 8k 

i think everybody has to get a say in proposal and should able to express their opinion 

Current proposal doesnt address these problems that i see 

**- New users post wont get any engagement , its already hard for new people to hit 20k governance and it will become it even harder , like why will someone reply to new user when their vote count no weight ("you will argue that it doesnt matter i will reply " yeah you might but i am saying majority wont and this is reality )**

People shouldnt be shut down when they share their opinion , just because you doesnt agree with someone
