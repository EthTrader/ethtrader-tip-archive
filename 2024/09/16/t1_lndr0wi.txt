Beleve it or not, people actually use Reddit not just to farm rewards.

On r/cc people still commented 100-150 times a day despite the 50comment rule.

r/cc still had plenty of natural engagement even when moons were dead.

Many people will still engage naturally.

But, this was not my proposal so I can't answer questions about why it was created.
