[Governance Poll Proposal] Limit the number of comments eligible for rewards, per 24 hours

## Current situation

This subreddit implemented the comment-to-vote system recently, which shifted the method of rewarding Donuts from purely karma-based metrics, to a system that relies on engagement through tipping.

Even though this was a step in the right direction to combat manipulation, alt accounts, and spam, the issue of comment spamming is still a problem. Many users are still submitting more than 100, and sometimes even 200 comments daily, in an attempt to maximize their rewards.

This behavior is leading to a flood of low quality content, which lowers the overall value of the sub and interferes with the distribution of Donut rewards.

## Problem

Despite the implementation of comment-to-vote, comment spamming is still a problem. This is driven by users trying to earn more Donuts through sheer quantity, rather than contributing with good content.

The result is a ‚Äùrat race‚Äù mentality, where more people are competing harder to earn less. This is not what EthTrader should be about. As a community, we should be promoting a system that values quality over quantity, making sure that all users have a fair chance to earn without having to resort to excessive farming.

## Solution

To address this issue, I propose introducing a cap on the number of comments **per user** that are eligible to earn Donuts, every 24 hours.

Users would still be free to comment beyond this limit, but only the first 50 comments would be eligible to earn.

This cap would encourage users to focus on the quality of their comments, rather than the quantity, thus creating a more balanced and just ecosystem for everyone.

## Advantages

1. By limiting the number of eligible comments, users are incentivized to make each comment count, leading to a higher overall quality of discussion on the forum.
2. With fewer comments, the rewards ratio per comment is going to increase. This would allow users to earn more collectively, without having to flood the subreddit with excessive comments.
3. Users would no longer feel pressured to post large quantities of comments to maximize their earnings. This means people can spend less time on the sub, while still maintaining a fair chance to earn.
4. This measure would help curb the excessive farming currently seen, and create a more balanced system where everyone wins, not just those who have figured out how to take advantage of the system.

## Disadvantages

1. Users who currently post a large number of comments every day might feel that this proposal limits their ability to earn. The goal is to create a fairer system for all.

‚Äî

## Conclusion

EthTrader is at a critical point, where the number of farmers is increasing, but the rewards are dropping due to oversaturation and spamming. This creates a rat race mentality that is not in line with the community‚Äôs values.

To promote a healthier, more balanced ecosystem, we need to implement measures that curb excessive farming. If we introduce a cap on the number of Donut-eligible comments, we can stabilize earnings and make sure that everyone has a fair chance to earn.

This change is necessary to preserve the quality of the forum, and to maintain a system that rewards good contributions over pure quantity.
