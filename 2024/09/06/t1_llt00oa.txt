Sorry to hear that FredNut ðŸ˜”

not sure this is hopium, but I found a [cool tool](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=09rXfXNt_Y4xTz9a) that let you see all Reddit RCAs organised from the ones you could like the most, to the ones you could like the least, according to your previous purchase!

try it, it's fun!
