The thing is, we went from one tool that wasn't good to another. But this seems to be causing problems again. I don't believe in AI tools. Example: The sun is shining today = 100% AI written. Where does it begin or where does it end? AI is becoming more and more like us. I saw a video in which OpenAI (makers of ChatGPT) had already presented a household robot prototype, but it still needs about 2 years until it is finished. AI is too fast to follow and this tools are not accurate.
