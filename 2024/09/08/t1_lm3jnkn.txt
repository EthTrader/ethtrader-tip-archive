Yeah Ive tried.... Sent modmail which the new RCA developer head gives me a link to send em direct mail in which they replied saying, "I would have been chosen as an artist but my region wasn't currently supported"

Right now Reddit only support 20 countries which no middle eastern countries is available on their list. But they told me to keep checking up on updates if they'll expand but which isn't part of their plan. So I just gave up.

I've designed some avatars as samples. This is one of em

Thanks for the suggestion btw, I hope they expand their region soon :)
