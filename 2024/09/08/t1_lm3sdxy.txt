>Polkastarter (POLS) is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, which is secured by a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that requires validators to stake 32 Ether. A set of decentralized nodes validates transactions and secures the Ethereum blockchain.

It was created around 2020/2021 during the bullrun. I was part of their airdrop then. It's an ERC 20 token.
