This is why I typically post [pre proposal discussion] before submitting an official governance proposal.

1) it can help fine tune some details

2) if I'm thinking 2 different numbers for a balance I can gauge which one is more popular

3) it gives mods/devs, the ones who would be implementing it, a chance to voice their opinion. And if they are against it or see something is infeasible, I won't even take it to an official proposal.

Of course. #3 requires mods/devs to see the post and respond.
