you're absolutely right mate, this rules doesn't make any sense, and I have said this over and over and over ðŸ˜…

I'm not having a good feeling about this sub, but anyway, rules of this sub can't change my "investing" strategy, but I'm still sorry that's affecting other bronuts 

nothing I can do, God knows I tried explaining why many of the rules here don't work, but people seems more invested in punish sellers rather than build buying pressure, with scarse results imo
