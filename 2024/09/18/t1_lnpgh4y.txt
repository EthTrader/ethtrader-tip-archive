Today is Wednesday and next Wednesday snapshot happens. IÂ´m confused. 

Sometimes Governance week is way too late in round and thing are just implemented in next rounds suddenly. Many here including me are confused when it comes to many new rules. 

Like last round one of my posts got deleted because I quoted in a link post (deleted due new 200 word rule)
