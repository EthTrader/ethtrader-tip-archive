well, as far as i've seen after the 50 comments cap- for newer users with less than 20k donut-contrib the lesser u have the lesser ur chances to get ur comment upvoted because most expect to get upvoted back & once ur voting power is zero or even low u r out of the game most of the time, while there r some support for posts by some old users trying to compensate the new users lose due to pay2post & trying to get them some donuts by the end of the round. "by the way were the last round donuts sent to our wallets ?"
