To me it makes sense, im not sure why Post and Comment's actually have different reward allocations anyway.

Like r/cc did, you can just play around with multipliers to find the balance of rewards.

I'd be curious to hear from the OG mods what the actual reasoning behind the split allocation was in the first place - and if it's still necessary with how farming and link spamming is, and other governance changes that have taken place. The sub is a VERY different sub today to 2019 and 2020.
