The problem about Vitalik's and ETH Foundation selling is weird don't know what's the reason why they sell or what triggers it. 

But I don't think selling will causes any thing in a long run but short run? YES.

LITECOIN FOUNDER sold his bags too years ago but investors still investing in Litecoin so don't panic guys, ETH will be fine
