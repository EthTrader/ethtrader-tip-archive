Any newbie who joins the sub cannot comment if they don't have up to 500 Karma. Even if the can, they will be excluded from distribution on account of insufficient Karma. Same applies for posts, anybody making posts with an account that has less than 1k comments should not expect to earn donuts from the posts.
