I posted for 1 month as a farmer just for the experience. I found that if you want to farm donuts, then all the best articles are off-limits. I even tried to copy and paste, lose  Bitcoin from the title, but still give credit to the author. The article gets removed.
The alternative was to find a low quality article like SBF, crypto scam or something about interest rates. 
This is why we are where we are. !tip 2
