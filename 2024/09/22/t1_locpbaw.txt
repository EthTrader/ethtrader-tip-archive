I've never been a Reddit mod.

It was actually a pretty cool experience on the other platform though, and on occasion some mods actually got temp banned themselves! (On their normal user account)

All the assigned Mods were actually given login credentials of another account, all of which were named after the moons of Neptune, like Nereid, Naiad, Triton, Thalassa etc.

And the thing was, you had to keep your identity secret, so none of the other mods knew who each other were.

Once in a while, when a mod would resign from their position, that would make an announcement, and it always shocked people when they discovered XX user was in fact a mod. Probably the best part of it xD
