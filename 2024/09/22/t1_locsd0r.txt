I think one of the biggest challenge is education. Sure there are a lot of advantages you get with using, let's say banks but the costs are too damn high. I'm talking transactional fees, monthly fees, invasion of privacy, and an illusion of control. One of the biggest frauds is the concept that a bank can freeze and undo a transaction. Sure they can, because nothing was actually sent in the first place. It's just a bunch of digital IOUs being sent around. We've long been conditioned to give up our freedoms under the guise of governance. !tip 1
