Personally, I'd rather have more manual moderation than rely on automation.

Rather than posts get deleted, and users fork out the Pay2Post fee for text posts that don't need 200 words, I would rather they simply flair posts that don't meet that requirement as "fluff" or "question" so they still get the 0.1x multiplier.

Instead, we rely on the bot to automate that process, and its does mean we automatically cut out low effort posts altogether (Not strictly a bad thing) but it doesn't allow for new users to post their 0.1x multiplier questions.
