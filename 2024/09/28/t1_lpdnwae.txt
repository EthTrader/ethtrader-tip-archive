From what i have noticed since i joined Ethtrader is that you can't freaking change the behaviour of users. Its just a rat race to post 3 links a day without even looking at the content.

Also, most of the time I've personally experienced with my own posts that text posts are ignored by most of the users as they have to go through the contents to make a comment. While the link posts are easy to engage by just reading the title.

There are already so many rules implemented for nerfing the links, the problem is it ain't as effective as everyone assumed. I'm not sure any changes are gonna have any effects on it.
