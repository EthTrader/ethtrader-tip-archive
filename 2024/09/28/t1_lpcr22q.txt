if you want to encourage more trading post then we need stop flaring trading post as media , i dont post a lot of trades here because of these two reason -

1. i cant explain every trade i take in 200 words ,most of "explanation" in on charts and cant write 200 words just to make a bare minimum quota ,

2. trades dont get a lot of attention because people are not interested in trading to begin with 

u/Prog132487 can understand this , matter of fact we been sharing more trades on discord than the subreddit itself
