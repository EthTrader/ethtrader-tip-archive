Man all this complaining all the time from the same 10 people. Since those 10 are so active it could be your duty to change things here. Go make an original post or go interact without counting every of your comments etc... Sorry for the rant, but reading the same narrative in a ciclejerk from people which could change things here by acting differently is really quit depressing.
