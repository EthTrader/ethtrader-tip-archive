>Ethereum-based projects have long been celebrated for their substantial treasuries, with some claiming billions of dollars in native tokens. However, a closer examination reveals that these impressive figures might be more illusion than reality, as many of these assets are backed by volatile or illiquid tokens. This situation presents a serious risk to the stability of these projects, raising concerns about their financial health.


Is this FUD or real? I just don't know what to believe anymore.
