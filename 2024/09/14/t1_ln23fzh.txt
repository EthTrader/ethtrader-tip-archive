The only thing I saw coming that they might sunset was reddit community points and that's because it was on TESTNET BETA and they said it's not worth money and not buying and selling.

>I think they're using the achievements avatars to replace RCPs they sunset as they won't be able to bring back RCPs. Wall Street Bet already got their own avatars, and each community might get their own unique avatars where you can tip each other avatars or if possible buying special membership with avatars.

That's just my imagination, since the GOLD awards was a failure. But who knows their plans. it might or might not be possible.
