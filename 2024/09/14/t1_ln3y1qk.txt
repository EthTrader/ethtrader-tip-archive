Like WTF it‘s showing old post is 3 hours old and new is 1-2 minutes. 

I got so many deleted post due shit 200 word rule, made quotes +source as link automod and got deleted. I‘m just pissed of this many rules also AI >75% link posts. I don‘t wanna check als the time. We have to check for double posts and much more. I lost fun in this sub, feels like work for me now. It was a place to chill, IT WAS..
