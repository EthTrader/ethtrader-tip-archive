60% ETH / 25% BTC / 15% AAVE

I sold some ETH at a profit and deeply regret ruining my $2282 cost average. I stood by hoping for another dip so i could throw it all+plus profits back into ETH but the dip never came ðŸ¥²

Glad to see ETH rebounding a bit but for now, iâ€™m standing by with fiat and if it surpasses a $2400 resistance, iâ€™ll accept the L and start to DCA away as I used to when I got into my positions.
