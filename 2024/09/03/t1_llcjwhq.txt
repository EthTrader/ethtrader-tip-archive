The proposal isn't worded super clearly imo or it is just me who struggles understanding it. (Respectfully). I also think that the farmers with 20k governance power aren't mostly the ones who dump their donuts after each round.  Examples: myself, sky, fredzor, odd radio, rikbona, master bad etc. 

As far as I can understand it it also sounds complicated to implement & I don't think that the 20k governance barrier is that much of a barrier tbh. I tip 1 almost every user that doesn't share terrible b**** and I don't discriminate (as in tipping less to someone who couldn't tip me with a full multiplier.). I also think that we just changed the system and should let it rest for a while and not try to reinvent the wheel every single round. 

[No] for me with the suggestion to perhaps word the proposal more clearly.
