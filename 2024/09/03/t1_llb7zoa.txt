Certainly some people can have their actual income reduced, or lost altogether.

But, also to factor in other cost of living increases. Perhaps rent goes up, or utility costs, or even those extra cents on each grocery item like bread and milk. Insurance costs can go up as well, etc.

I'm in a similar boat, I wouldn't be in trouble personally, and would still be able to load up crypto... but it would delay my goals nonetheless xD
