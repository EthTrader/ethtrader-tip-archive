I see your point here and I'm still not sure about something. After this comment cap is reduced, will the tip you make after you've exceeded your 50 comments still count? And will the tip you receive still count as well? Will this rules, this might be too hard to implement, as I'm not even a programmer but I know it won't be easy.

I have try saying we should have 50 comments per 24hours in the past as well, but that was when there's no TIP2VOTE. But I don't see any problems in this round, the total comment users make isn't up to 4k in 28 days(I'm not sure about that yet though) but it's better than the comments some people make before T2V (which is 14k comments in 28days).

If this proposal passes, to reduce the comments cap, they'll surely be alts. This proposal is to improve alts account but anyways, I'll be cool with whatever happens.
