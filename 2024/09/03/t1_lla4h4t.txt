A law against crypto would be dissuasive, but infringing on peoples freedom wouldn't be popular politics, even less so if a failure to enforce is basically guaranteed from the get go.

The perfect example is the Bitcoin ban in China. I wouldn't dare act against the CCP directive but people did & China still has one of the largest shares in Bitcoin hash rate globally.

Decentralized protocols are powerful. How powerful is often underestimated by politicians.
