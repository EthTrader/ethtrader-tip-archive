I gave up on having a voice a few months back and I definitely accept the consequences, no worries.
You may not remember this, but I bought a nice deal of donuts, provided to LP and supported the sub organising  several contests on other subs to bring people in here, with a discrete success, I think.

I was just pointing out that people here keep complaining about too high selling pressure then that's not even true, while is true the opposite: there no buying pressure.

and part of that I think is because the way this sub has taken with all the rules, that can't be changed since it is not very Decentralized if you consider a bunch of people have a great deal of governance score, while newcomers votes count as shit.

There are other RCC subs with like 1k members, and absolutely no topic to be discussed and their tokens with a MC of like 10k USD with an higher buying pressure than us, and with more Activity on the sub, just because the whole experience is way better and enjoyable, and that's what people wants, beside the farming factor that is common to all the RCC subs
