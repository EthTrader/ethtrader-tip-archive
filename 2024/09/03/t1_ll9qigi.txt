Making as much money as I can.

I've been locked the fuck in for months doing all kinds of things. Been looking into prop firm trading, and making connections with memecoin devs (no rugpulls lol, dont be worried haha)

My honest goal is financial freedom, but I'm reaching for the stars. 

Hopefully, one day I'll write my success story on this sub. But until then, I'm on the grind.

Here's another tip. Feeling generous today. !tip 10
