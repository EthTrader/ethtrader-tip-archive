I don't know if you are trolling us or not but from a psychology point of view, you won't get any better if you keep spamming negative comments and telling yourself how terrible everything is. You are just reinforcing your negative mindset in a loop. If you're really struggling I'd tell myself "Okay, I have made a mistake and invested more than I could lose. I'll do better know and buy less risky assets. I'll stop complaining and recognize that life is full of opportunities and everyone does mistakes. I'll come back stronger." 


From a financial perspective, Ethereum is a speculative asset and you should diversify and buy index funds if you have issues sleeping at night. Not putting more than you can afford to lose etc.  

Keep your head up buddy and stop crying.
