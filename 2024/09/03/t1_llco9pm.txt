Then you really should take a step back mate. Probably leave the sub for a while. I have quite some experience with mental health issues and it doesn't look healthy (genuinely caring for you here and my apologies if I sounded condescending). Perhaps a month off from everything crypto might help. 

Obsessions (Oh no Ethereum is a terrible investment I did so poorly) often get fed by compulsions (do you guys think it'll do better?? Will it recover?) & the constant search of reassurance. You should try (it can be hard) to accept the worst and somehow move on. Consider it a lost investment if you can and focus on more productive things in your life. No investment makes it worth losing your mental health.
