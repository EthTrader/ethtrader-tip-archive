I currently do like once per week already haha 

It is hard to notice but I also think about the opportunity cost of checking charts constantly. It distracts you from other stuff. But some people are better at multitasking. I just think that we are way to distracted nowadays and a plethora of input (social media etc.) can be damaging for the mind.
