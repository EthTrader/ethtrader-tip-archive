[NO] i would say yes, but a governance pool opens the door for alot of users losing their wallets for whatever reasons and i dont want to vote for every user at a time, this is the second proposal in 2 days. 

I would rather see a proposal which introduces rules for users which have lost their wallet for whatever reasons. I don't want to vote for every user or edge case. Obviously if this pool comes to life i still vote yes... But i would like a more general approach. If we are doing it we should do it right.
