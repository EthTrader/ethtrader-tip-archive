> To address this issue, I propose introducing a cap on the number of comments per user that are eligible to earn Donuts, every 24 hours.

Will this work similar to how the post cooldown works (minus the removal of course) in that it's uniquely calculated per user?

Or will it be more of a case that it's a sub-wide 24 hour period, eg, 12:00am UTC to 11:59pm UTC.

If it's a set time-frame sub-wide, i would suggest that this specific time is not actually specified or known beyond MattG's calculations as to prevent gaming of the system.
