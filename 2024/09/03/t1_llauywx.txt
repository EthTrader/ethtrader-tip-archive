>why did you stop?

I don't wanna spend other time on this, since I complained already a lot when it all happened, but I stopped caring about this sub when I was treated unfairly by mods.


>Itâ€™s ironic, though, that the ones who usually complain about these "rules", are the ones who got banned from r/CryptoCurrency for said rules

I joined before my ban and I don't think my complaining is related to that ðŸ™‚
I'm one of the top earner each distro, and the rules are only making me earning more donuts, since they discouraged newcomers and people with less time to be active, and yet I point out that they are bad cause it's evident, people are leaving, sub is dying.
"you" are trying to work on a better sub because are sick of people farming and selling Donuts each distro, but you're only making it easier for us to earn, that's a fact, look at the distro file and the sellers addressesðŸ™‚



>Regarding the "rules" you're frustrated about, these were governance decisions made by the (decentralized) DAO. They werenâ€™t imposed top-down

that's the point, I don't think this DAO is working. how is fair giving more power to users only because they have been here for ages, when ratios were paying 200k donuts and contrib per round, when now AVG distro only pays like 5k Donuts?
How things can ever change when 500 new users count less than 5 of the OG ones?
this "DAO" is not opened to new ideas for how it is built
