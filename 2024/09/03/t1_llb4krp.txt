That I donâ€™t know. I would assume that they will stay up until the rule is active.

If not, mods should have said that the rule is in place even if not yet implemented.

But Iâ€™m just guessing. Looks like most people are not yet following the 3 hour rule. So either Iâ€™m correct, or Iâ€™m wrong and most of us will get a million nuked postsðŸ˜‚

Anyway, Iâ€™d expect clear communication if they would manually be deleting posts. I havenâ€™t heard anything
