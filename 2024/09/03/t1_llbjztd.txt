Sometimes I post 50 comments in a day, I know I do but only because there a hundreds of posts and I want to keep up with every one of them. If we limit posts and comments, then I won't have to try as hard to earn and then I can earn the same or even more. So that's a yes from me. Also I consider myself pretty active, sometimes I'm offline for days but when I'm on I post around 50 comments and I think that's a lot. 100 or more is just madness and means having no life outside reddit, I'm sorry but that's how I see it. Thanks FA!!
