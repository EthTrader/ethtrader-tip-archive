From what I understand, they want sellers and suppliers to focus on building quality products rather than chasing quick sales. Traditional DEXs are like stores that charge a fee in the goods being sold, leading to fast profits but little longterm growth. These guys want to collect fees in ETH and distribute them to those who help maintain the market, encouraging a focus on lasting success rather than just immediate gains.
