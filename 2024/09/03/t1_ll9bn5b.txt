That's actually not true and only your perception.
I ran the numbers multiple times on average people with less weight get more tips send to them than they send, l√§sst round 1.2  tips for every tip they send. 

If you feel that way it has more to do with your communication than a general trend. E. G. You did not tip in your very first comment... People which do not upvote but still engage are not as likely to get upvotes or a response back.
