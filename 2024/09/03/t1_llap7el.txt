This assumes the market will be better than years past. We’ve already seen some solid highs. They just aren’t as high as past highs, relative to the lows. Again, everyone assumes this will act like it did in the past. And, assume this is an investment of some sort (though for the SEC we assume it isn’t an investment contract). 

All I’m saying is what if this is as good as it gets?
