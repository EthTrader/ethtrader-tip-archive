If you have to be thinking about people everytime and whatever they're saying, you won't do anything. People just make fun of people selling to look superior. Just do what makes you happy and don't give a fvck about what internet people said about your decision. 

It's to easy to read and forget what anyone said about your decision if you have lots of things you're focusing on IRL, people just like to annoy people on the internet (keyboard warriors). Just don't give a fvck about anything anyone says
