>Maybe it's because Binance lists low cap coins? 

Like seriously? Binance lists low cap coins? I don't think you've used Binance before. Binance is always the last to list and many times, the coin about to be listed is at its peak. 
Why in God's name will anyone compare Binance to Coinbase? Even with their many troubles the past one year, Binance is still the biggest exchange and also with the strongest pull.
