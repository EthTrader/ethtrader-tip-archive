i think the current interest rate might b able to stabilize inflation at least until geopolitical situation worsen, "positive factors for the crypto bull run have begun to line up, the start of the US rate cut cycle as well as the reduced policy risk from the US election given that both candidates appear to know the importance of appealing to the crypto savvy voters" agree, expected that scenario & seems to b true so far. hope for the best anyway
