Oooh cool!!! Ledger is the way!

Just the usual ones: Linea, Scroll, Hyperlane, etc... Also some passive farms on Ethereum, like Mitosis, Zircuit. A bunch of telegram mini apps and most recently I've also started taking part in exchange-sponsored activations, like "trade 100 USDT in crypto and earn a share of XXX airdrop".
