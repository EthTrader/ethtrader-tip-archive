I agree with you on everything, apart from one small point

I struggle to think of *any* Layer 2s that have survived multiple cycles. Are there? Even the token with the most activity, ARB wasnâ€™t even around in the 2021 run.

In that sense, even Dogecoin has been around longer than Layer 2s. Hard for me to class them in the high use case category that has whethered many storms ..

High quality post all round I must say - !tip 3.69
