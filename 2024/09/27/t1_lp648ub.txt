>It feels like every other day, another project promising huge returns is shilled over the news and social media. Amateur investors like us rush to buy in and briefly it feels like everybody is a winner. Prices skyrocket and charts look promising and all those who jumped in early feel like they have struck jackpot. This is then followed by a sudden decline, the same project/token that looked unstoppable now suddenly crashes, leaving many in pain

You made me just remember the LUNA crashes
