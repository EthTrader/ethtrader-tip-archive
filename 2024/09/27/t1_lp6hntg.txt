I’m mentioning specifically in terms of the last 2 days since the 50 cap came into place, not the last few months 

Just my personal observation. It’s one argument that new users can come to the sub not for rewards, but what I’ve seen is what I’ve said.

I’d be interested to see what the stats are come the end of the round for new users.
