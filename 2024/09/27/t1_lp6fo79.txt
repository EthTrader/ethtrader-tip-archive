We wished for this, don't forget it!

People stopped replying to posts like they used to because 50 comments is nothing and they run out fast.

I personally try to spread my 50 comments equally to almost everyone. But this is impossible! Also, by the third post you are 100% at 0. This suggestion was poorly thought out, but we all voted for it.

The results will be as follows:

1. Totally dead Daley.

2. Big inconvenience for old users who to answer and if it is fair.

3. Forget that someone new will want to join.

4. Absolute centralization among the few users who are most active.

There are probably more negatives, but these are the ones that quickly come to mind.

Comments should have been limited to at least 75, although they are also few.
