For round 141 a user with less weight (i cant determine if they are new or just sold) got 1.1 tips for every tip they made. 

For round 141 a user with less weight got 0.8 tips for every tip they make, thus far.

Data from an hour ago less weights send 1382 tips and received 1151 tips, as i said numbers are not solid yet.
