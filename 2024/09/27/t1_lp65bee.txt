Can I also add that this 50 comments cap has actually affected the NEW USERS the worst ??

When I saw the poll, it said that it would benefit new users because of higher comment ratio but this has been the furthest from the truth

In practice what I’ve seen over the past few days is more than 95% of newbie comments getting ZERO tips, because many people don’t want to ‘waste’ 1 out of 50 comments tipping these new users and getting nothing back.

This is the biggest issue imo, if new people are getting nothing they are not gonna stick by for long!
