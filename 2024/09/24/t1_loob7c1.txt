Exactly. My thought process is that the point of the flair multipliers is to help promote a balanced variety of post types, and balanced rewards. It's just up to the users to tip them of course.

I don't want comedy to not exist, but I don't want 10 comedy posts on the front page at a time either. Same for links, I don't want them to no longer be posted, but I want to see a couple of more high level discussion posts making their way to the front page every few days.
