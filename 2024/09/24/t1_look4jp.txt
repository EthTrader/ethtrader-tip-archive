I remember that time. We begged for changes, but the people enjoying the perks of the sub at the time refused to bulge. Even when I was against T2V, every other person in this sub supported it. Right now, some of them are coming back to say they don't like  it, but it's a waste of time.

As far as Aminok is here, T2V is here to stayðŸ˜„
