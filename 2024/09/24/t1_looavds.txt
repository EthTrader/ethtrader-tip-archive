I think posting only a link should be stopped entirely.

If anyone finds a good article, make a text post about your thoughts on it & add the link as source.

I have the feeling many just share links without reading the articles themselves, much less look at them with some critical thinking. Getting people to write 3 sentences about the information sharing their own thoughts would mitigate this behavior and increase post quality. We need original content, not link sharing & copy paste action.
