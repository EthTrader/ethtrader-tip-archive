I will try to give you the best possible answer but I may be wrong - I dont think rate cuts and inflation have an automatic relationship. If the economy has unused capacity - for example high unemployment, unused factories - a rate cut can create growth without causing much inflation. Inflation would be more related to central banks and the fed !tip 1
