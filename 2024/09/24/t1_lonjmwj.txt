G'day, thanks for hosting this AMA.

Given the competition of other cards, such as the Crypto.com and Coinbase cards  - what else makes Gnosis stand out? (Aside from linking to onchain wallets)

What will be the point of difference for me to switch from using my CDC card to Gnosis Pay?

Are regulatory conditions one of the biggest hurdles to overcome when looking at expanding to more countries?
