"Decreasing the policy interest rate can stimulate economic activity and cause inflation to rise. Lower interest rates encourage people to spend more and save less. Lower rates reduce the amount needed to pay off debt and that means more people will borrow money for major purchases like a new vehicle. This encourages manufacturers to build more vehicles. Demand for auto parts, hours for factory workers and commissions for salespeople all go up. These workers have more money to spend and that increases overall demand in the economy. Lower rates also reduce incentives to save money because returns are lower and that encourages people to spend more of their money. This is how lowering the policy interest rate increases demand in the economy and causes inflation to rise."
