Split the middle ground, let's to 0.666 Multiplier!

But in all seriousness, I would rather wait and see the impact of the topic limiter being introduced first before discussing any further meta changes.

Many users are trying to post 3 submissions every day, regardless of type.

If you nerf link multipliers too much, then people will flood the front page with low quality text posts just to hit 200 words, and that's not useful for the sub either.

[NO] for now
