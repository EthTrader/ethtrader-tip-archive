Idk. I thini we should change something about the constant shilling of memecoins. It’s clearly a loophole since they are on ETH.

I don’t mean that they couldn’t be posted, but since everyone is exploiting this tactic, I might wanna change that.

This memecoin rubbish could actually end up costing people losing money
