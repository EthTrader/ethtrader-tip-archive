>Link-post spams

The links that are posted here are low quality. News links were nerfed but that didn't help, maybe we should filter low quality news sources. 

What amazes me is that some people post articles without even reading them, that's why you can see alot of scam coin links being posted. 

>Newcomers to the subreddit aren't getting many tips

I try my best to tip users regardless of their tip weight or who they are.

Cheers OP 🍻
