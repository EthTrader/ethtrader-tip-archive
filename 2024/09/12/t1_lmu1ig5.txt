>Another factor no one really talks about, and arguably the most important one, is **luck**.

Luck is an aspect of any type of trading. It's all about probabilities. That being said, it is possible to get an edge trading memecoins - that's why some lose all their money, and others can consistently get good results.

It's a **way** different mentality when it comes to trading for sure, and you made some very good points about speed, and memecoins being all about hype. It's mostly about psychology imo.

>If you really want to get into memecoins and become the ultimate degen memecoin trader, hunt on Ethereum or one of the L2s

Hmmmm, debatable. Most memecoin hunters are on other chains like Solana, or even Tron. I've personally had **much more** success with Solana when it comes to memecoins. Memecoins on BASE chain for example have been extremely slow to move from what I've seen.

It depends how you want to trade memecoins too. Some people like to degen on quick 'in-and-out' plays for a quick 2-3x, while others like to buy solid projects and ride them to the top of the bullrun (like pepe, or brett). I'd say I'm in between and I like to swing trade lowcaps.

Being strategical with entries is everything. Too many 'traders' FOMO in after a big pump and end up getting dumped on.
