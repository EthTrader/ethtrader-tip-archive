Detailed reasons why I am voting [no]

* Most people (not all) who are complaining about Pay2Post fee are having their posts removed because they are posting duplicates, or off-topic content or paid shills. This can simply be avoided in most cases by spending half a minute reading what their article actually is, and a couple of minutes browsing the sub. 

* We have a limit of 3 posts in 24 hours we can create. With DONUT cost removed, users will be more inclined to post 3 times per day, everyday, because worst case scenario, their post gets removed, and they still receive the tips, even if the tipvote is not counted, the tip itself is still processed.

* Pay2Post is still a good feature as an anti-spam measure, we see how many duplicate stories get removed as it is... just wait until the same story takes up 8 of the top 20 posts - waiting for a Mod to come online and clear the clutter - because lets face it, nobody wants to be that guy that nukes other peoples posts

* As an anti-spam measure, removing this will create more work for the mods - and moderation duties already appear to be spread rather thin. It's not like duplicates are being removed 10 minutes after posting, they are on the front page for hours to most of a day in some cases.

* Removing Pay2Post will also mean there is no discouragement from posting low quality content of comedy/media/self-story - which is part of the reason why those flairs have reduced multipliers in the first place. If someone can't find an article, and there is no Pay2Post, users might be inclined to just post a low quality comedy/media post just to use their 3 posts allowed per 24 hours.
