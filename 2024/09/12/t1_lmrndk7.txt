The only problem I see in this sub is the lack of no love and everyone thinking they're perfect or better than the rest. Look at conehead for example, no matter the amount of bitcone you hodl, you'll still be tipped and getting avatars (even if you're a newbies).

I've been in jujutsufolk & FortniteBR subreddit, even the most shittiest meme got good upvotes(which both sub aren't even RCPs)

We all are bias here. If you're not part of the top earners or you gave up farming, they'll be rules to reduce the new farmers from farming but forgot if you also aren't farming, you won't have that lots RCPs in your wallet.

We abuse people that they're farmers, they have no jobs etc but forgot that when RCPs was still supported by Reddit and kraken listed both moons and bricks, they're lots people who went over to FortniteBR and farm bricks too.

It's because the only RCPs available and still relevant is currently donuts, so some people just gave up farming and won't like it when newbies are farming and earnings. So we try to brings rules to reduce the earnings and make everyone total earnings accurate.

I still remember when Kirtash was top earner, they was proposal that we should have a cap for earnings, which most didn't agree to it. People work for this, if you want to earn like them then be active like them.

And I've never seen any problems with mods here, we might need new mods but the truth is, mods are humans. They volunteer to be mods, they also have IRL activities. Ray has been active recently, my today post was hammered by him and I've deleted it myself. If they should be another person to be active as him, I wouldn't care but I don't think mod is a problem at all but I might be wrong
