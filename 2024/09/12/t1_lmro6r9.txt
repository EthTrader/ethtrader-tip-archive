I would consider reducing some of the comment/post rewards, and pooling them into another allocation. Then, when we have things like AMA's, part of the deal can be the Advertiser picks the top X best/inspired questions for DONUT rewards.

I'd also look at having a mod who's lurking the sub and they can tip/reward content that is inspired/informative/detailed.

Currently 1 person asking a simple question is getting 3 or 4 tips, from 3 or 4 people answering, but often a highly detailed answer might only get 1 tip back.

So, I'd introduce a mod who's role is to reward quality content that displays knowledge and understanding, or helpful educating.
