I guess we can somewhat agree. I'd say Base is probably the one with the most potential, but I strongly stand against Solana purely because it's mostly rug pulls. The risk-reward ratio isn't worth it at all.

As for Tron, not very familiar in terms of memecoins. But I'm not a massive fan of it purely because of Justin Sun.
