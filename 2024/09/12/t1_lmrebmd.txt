It would be good is post removals happened more frequently rather than once every 1 or 2 days.  Sometimes paid shills last a whole day before getting removed. User who have attempted "Distributed Moderation" in the past have either been blocked in retaliation, no longer get tipped by said users, or complained that they've been targeted.

It will also be good when the topic limiter comes in, we really don't need 5 SHIB posts on the front page at any given time.
