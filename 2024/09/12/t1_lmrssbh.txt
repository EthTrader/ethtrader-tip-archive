>Hell, even Kraken staff don't frequent this sub anymore because of the decline in quality and the pestering for a listing.

Tbh I don't think the quality has anything to do with kraken. I rarely see em anywhere else. They just appear when someone mentioned them. I've mentioned them lots of times here and the responded.

The ones using that account doesn't care or knows anything about what kraken will list or not. They're just "support" trying to help redditors. BuT I agree with every other things you said

>Recently Binance staff posted in our sub- we had 3 comments that actually answered a question they asked about stable coins. Not a good look if advertisers want to use a forum for feedback and engagement.

Especially this. I think I've seen the main reason why create a sub for moons discussion. If we want this sub to what it was meant to be, we needs to limit the discussion of donuts, both comments and post. And we shouldn't be delusional and be tagging kraken support or other exchanges and be asking for WEN LISTING. It makes us immature tbh
