I'll repeat what I commented earlier;

The news article itself doesn't need to be 200 words.

But if you are posting it as a Text Submission, instead of a Link Submission, it will be removed.

Some users post news as Text Submissions, and write a few dot points about the article; but if under 200 words, the Text Submission will be removed.

Just post as a link and you'll be fine;
