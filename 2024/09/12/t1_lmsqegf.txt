Maybe if we didn't have so many restrictions, we wouldn't see posts with the same topic every day.

We have 3 posts a day and it's really hard with all these demands to find something that hasn't already been posted. So I don't blame anyone!

Most users here don't engage with newcomers at all, that's 100% true. Feedback is a must to predispose newcomers.

I try to reply to absolutely everyone who writes to me, regardless of how many donuts they have. I think this is evident in my tip deficit.

There are also users who write in every post but never reply to theirs. Try guys because this doesn't look good.
