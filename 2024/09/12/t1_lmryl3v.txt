The other thing is, tipping and using DAO rewards should not be just blindly given to every post out there.

It shouldn't matter what a users tip weight is, or who is posting something - but if a user, whether it's someone who has just registered, or even Aminok himself, if they post something that is against the rules, a paid shill, a duplicate. I'm not tipping it.
