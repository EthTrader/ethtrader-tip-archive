The problem is not the fee, but that valuable posts are being removed. Also, this round is full of technical errors where posts are removed for no reason. We really need to vote to allow a wider range of posts. We can't publish 200 posts a day about Eth prices, L2 and the "growth" of ERC-20 memecoins.

When we adopted the new rules (and they get bigger with each round), we expected newcomers to be pushed away. And that's a fact. Centralization is increasing all the time! I don't know about you, but for me the only rule that works well is changing the voting system and removing spam on the Daily.

We need new people to promote Donut, and they are not coming. So something in the system is lame!
