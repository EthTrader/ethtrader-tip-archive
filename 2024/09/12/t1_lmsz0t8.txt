There's so much that's bothering me at the moment. you find a post but it contains a different L-1. Even if Ethereum is well represented. For example, Ethereum outperforms Cardano by far in trading volume, this post is not allowed. We sometimes act as if there is only Ethereum and its ecosystem, but we turn a blind eye to important posts that make Ethereum look good compared to other L-1s. I don't understand why posts like this aren't allowed.
