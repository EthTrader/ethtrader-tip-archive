>2: Newcomers to the subreddit aren't getting many tips. I see most of the top users try to engage with everyone no matter what their donut count is but some of the users don't engage with users that don't have enough donuts (less than 20k donuts/governance score). This is so sad. I think everyone should be treated equal. We should be welcoming newcomers. Please don't forget we were all a newcomer to this sub. It's important to treat them equally.

This is very important. As someone that fall under the 20k range for a short period I felt so many things down there. I think we must encourage that people to keep being active.
