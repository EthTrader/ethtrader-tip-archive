>What amazes me is that some people post articles without even reading them, that's why you can see alot of scam coin links being posted.

Hoenstly, we should punish the people that tip those posts too xD

Duplicates and non-macro is one thing, but, if an article mentions PreSale of shit like Raboo, KangaCoin or Mpepe, both the poster, and the tippers should get a DONUT fine! xD
