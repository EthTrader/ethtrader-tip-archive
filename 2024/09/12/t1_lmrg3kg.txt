too many smart ass repeating this sub needs quality and then wen quality posts are made, nobody ever read or engage with themðŸ˜…
but then they keep tipping their buddies like we all do

mods are non existent, they only show up to nuke posts

too many rules, most of them made to prevent bronuts from farming, while these rules have only increased the rewards for us farmers

too few mods, some of them even bad at what they do

these are just the starters imo 

this sub was way better months ago, more active users, more discussions, mods ere more partecipate
