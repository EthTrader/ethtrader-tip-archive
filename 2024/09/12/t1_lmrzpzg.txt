The problem is, Exchanges have KPI's as well. We could pay 50k for a listing, get a pump n dump, then go 3 months of the same crabbing we are doing now, and then get delisted for underperforming.

MEXC for example, if tokens fail to get 50k Trading volume per day on average for a month, they will put it on the "watch list" - if another month passes and it still fails to hit those targets, it gets delisted.
