Err there’s a lot. But these came to mind:

Needs more mods, maybe even more devs. Mattg is doing an amazing work but sadly many *great ideas* have to be pushed back cause he’s fully booked. This hinders donut development.

For a sub of this size, there’s what, under 50 of us ”BroNuts” that is crazy. I’ve been here for a year and I’ve seen no growth at all. We should be able to sell ourselves better, somehow.

Maybe we have too many rules, idk. I understand that rules are needed but the fact is that this place is overwhelming for a newcomer. End of the day, humans are simple. If this sub gives a first bad impression, these dudes might just end up leaving. Maybe it ain’t about the rules itself, but that the rules can be tricky to find. One idea could be that everytime someone uses the ! Register command, the bot would paste them a link to all the sub rules. Needs to be obvious to find, all in one place.

Donuts: Well they are the reason the sub is about farming. It’s tricky to make this sub ”good” as long as donuts are distributed. Also, people will find workarounds regardless of *the next hot rule* is added. 

Tip weight: it sucks. The punishment of losing voting power is all that is needed for ”preventing selling” imo. If we really wanted to incentivize hodling why noy try to come up with like new tresholds for governance score; 100K u can do this, 300K that. At 1 mil maybe you can do something insanely cool.
