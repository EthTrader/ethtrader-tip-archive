I for one profited nicely from those airdrop guides, but unfortunately theres just not much left happening in the airdrop world... some shitty little telegram games, and the most anticipated ones like LINEA and SCROLL would be at a stage where it's too late to get started.

But, sadly, HuntNut has reported that he gets tipped more from posting links then he does the guides, which take effort time write out.
