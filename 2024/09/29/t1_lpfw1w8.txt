Who knows.

Personally, I question why posts and comments are two separate calculations to begin with, which means two different ratios. Someone posting 3 links a day earns more than someone posting 50 comments a day.

I feel we ended up doing things a bit backwards, with a 50 comment rule in play, I almost feel like we should look at returning to upvotes for comments - because now that's in a controlled environment - and, except for the fact the sub was desperate for acitivity, and pushing that 50@50 club... we actually should've implemented a 50 comment cap before the switch to T2V in the first place.

Downvoting was only a problem on posts, due to the higher rewards allocation, and comment rewards were only abused because people could write GM Bronut, and post a GIF 200+ times a day.
