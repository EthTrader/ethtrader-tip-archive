I'm not sure how simpler I could put this, but I'll try.

I'm proposing to introduce a dynamic formula for determining advertising fees on r/EthTrader based on:

1. unique monthly views (UMV)
2. market value of DONUT (MV)
3. multiplier (M)

The formula would help us make sure that advertising costs reflect the subâ€™s traffic and market conditions. This would promote transparency and fairness.

I'm also proposing a discount system for extended rentals.

I guess TLDR: The goal is to replace outdated fixed fees and use a flexible pricing structure, while keeping fees reasonable as traffic changes
