Yeah, the Arbitrum playbook says you are only a Sybil if you have more than 20 wallets lol. But the point is you won't like to have your wallets connected to each other for every single airdrop as qualifying requirements across different airdrops vary greatly. If you have let's say 3 wallets you have been using for some time, with a legitimate footprint, then this won't pose any issues to you. However, if you are creating 3 fresh wallets just for the sake of an airdrop and you somehow make them interact with each other, not a very interesting practice.
