very weird ðŸ˜®

>Are you using it?

kinda. Not very often, but I use it when I have to take profit, and I always leave some stablecoins ready to buy back.

the UI is one of the best imo, easy and intuitive. Plus, it has always worked very smoothly to me.
And the fact the company is listed makes me feel bit safer.

I also use their hot wallet, and it's great too imo

Overall, my experience is super good, but I find it a bit more expensive than other CEXs
