I guess everybody would make more posting links. there is still  a difference if you do it and if donuts really dictate everything here. You could also be just happy from what you get meaningful posts.

I think the main problem is that most people just game the system, if this would be a dog or cat lover sub they would post about that. If rules change again  the approach how to game the system would just change.
It would need a group of people which don't care that much about dounts, and the 5 to 30$ reward, but about the content itself. Or stop upvoting all the link posts.
