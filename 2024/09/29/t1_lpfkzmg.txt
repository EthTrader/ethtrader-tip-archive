I don't agree with removing Pay2Post fees, even for just text posts, for the exact reasons I commented in the previous proposal. It still ensures users are accountable and their submission meets content standards. Otherwise, it's just a free "roll of the dice"

Incentive not just comes from flair multipliers, but if users from the active user base. Even just some users, didn't tip the lower quality articles, and favoured tipping text posts, the more people that do this, that can allow your shift in what content might be posted more.

It's funny when I see users comment on a post letting them know "I already saw this article" and they still tip it. Like, you've just acknowledged it's going to be removed and you've still elected to reward it? That's just positive reinforcement.
