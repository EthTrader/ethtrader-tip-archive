If you qualify than I would say yes I think so

Taiko gave me about $50-$100 for the testnet. Berachain has higher funding compared to Taiko

All the other testnets were thrash tho. But none of them have funding at Berachainâ€™s level, it also depends how many % of the supply they decide to allocate to a-drops (not announced)
