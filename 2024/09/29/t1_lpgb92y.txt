The thing about airdrops is the criteria are not actually released until after a snapshot is taken. 

Personally, I only use one wallet for airdrops - but some people use multiple.

Some projects will put in anti-sybil and anti-bot detection.

My approach is just to use 1 wallet and do things once in a while; and that's seemed to work well for me.
