Theres been a slight shift in the last 3 or 4 rounds, some users have started to appreciate some of the new rules and changes and that's evident in some of their responses when governance proposal discussions take place. Theres always going to be some noise and resistance to change, but a lot of what has been brought in will have longer term benefits, despite short term disgruntlement.
