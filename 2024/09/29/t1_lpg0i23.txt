I don't know why anyone wouldn't be to be honest. But, that's just unrealistic expectation and greed I guess.

I was going to be staking my ETH anyway, so may as well get some additional rewards in someone's offering it! xD

And yes, it's good to see people doing even just a small amount of due diligence and research before investing into anything!
