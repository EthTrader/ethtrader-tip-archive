>I know you guys like to hodl a lot

exactly, the impression I always have reading here is that nobody ever sell 🙃

personally, I feel like a boring investor... but any chance I get to take profit, I do it.

at the end of the day I'm here for some sweet gain, can't wait for a Lambo without ever cashing out

PS: great post OP💪🏻
