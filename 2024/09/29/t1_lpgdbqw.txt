I literally just did, what coincidental timing lol

But to answer your question, you are generally right as well. A few reasons:

1) Many airdrops that I’m farming may be late to get started, I don’t want people ending up getting nothing and being disappointed

2) Airdrop rewards have becoming less rewarding with too many projects and I’ve also cut down on my farming as a result

3) Lastly a few of my recent airdrop posts (mainly about Zora which I’m actively farming) got very little engagement, these take time to make and end up getting less engagement than a link post that takes 10 seconds to post

So yeah those are the reasons, not much rewarding airdrops going on and even if I post I don’t see a lot of engagement anyway
