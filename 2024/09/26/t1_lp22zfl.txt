Grayscale never had intentions of staying for the long run. so it's better to exit now than in a bull run scenario, as it could break the bullish momentum, imo.

As for Dencun, it made participating in the ecosystem more "affordable", but I think it came with a lot of downsides. Namely fragmentation and reduction in revenue + gwei in the L1, which ends up being not ideal in terms of deflation.
