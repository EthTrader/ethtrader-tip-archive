15 users posted 75+ times for the month, that's pretty much 15 users posting the maximum each and every single day for the entire round.

You can either look at increasing content standards, which means more rules for people to get confused about.

Or you can reduce 3 posts per day down to 2 - which unfortunately, would be limiting in some cases.

Or, instead of 3 posts per day, you look at something else like 15 posts per week - but again, that'll confuse people and require more dev work.
