Outcome of ETFs weren't as expected. I blame Grayscale, Ethereum Foundation and a little bit on Dencun upgrade which moved majority of activities to L2s due to drop in their transaction costs. I may be wrong through about the last part. Only time will tell how it plays out in long term. 

Also Vitalik's proposal to increase blob count along with EIP 7623 seems like a good plan. Gotta wait and watch.
