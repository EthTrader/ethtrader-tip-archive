I'll probably vote [NO] on this.

The last thing we need is more link spam. If r/CryptoTrader is still in future plans, that's where it would be more appropriate, and theres always r/cryptocurrency for general news sharing.

I would however support Text posts, and users own research and analysis to allow the additional flexibility of comparing competing chains to Ethereum, this would allow more more leeway in what is hopefully content of a higher standard.
