It was when RCPs got listed on exchanges, and trading volume really spiked.

R/cc asked Sushi for some rewards because we were doing about 20-40k a day on average.

Even bricks were doing 10-20k daily

After 1 month they rebalanced and added some more ro moons, but reduced what bricks had.

But then they stopped Sushi rewards altogether when trading volume dropped
