>If yesterday you didn't sell an apple at $2, why would you sell the same apple at $1 today?

Tbh it doesn't happened in market because they'll believe the apple or the said product might decrease in value as people might not be interested in that said product.

People who sell the dip might have wanted to sell during pump but decided to HODL and waiting for more pump but instead it dip and they couldn't wait for it to get dipper(happens to me on several tokens though) and they might buy back
