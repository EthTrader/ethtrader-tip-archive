Starting to put in measurements like "75%" is hard to implement but I definitely agree that we should be able to post articles that are relevant to Ethereum even if the title includes things like BTC or other tokens. At the end of the day, the market moves with BTC for example and I never got the fixation of titles that never mention other tokens !tip 1
