not sus, I guess just not serious like it should be or something? ðŸ‘€

this one time I sent some funds to a wrong address, and I reached out to their contact centre to ask for help, they replied to me and helped me gaining backy funds, but they ask for a %

that alone wasn't that fishy, by the way they asked and the entire exchange we have via email, was kind of funny ðŸ¤£
very informal, like I was almost expecting for the guy to write me "hey broh" ðŸ¤£
