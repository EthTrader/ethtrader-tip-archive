I think that’s a pretty high average cost. I’d recommend trying to average down if you can.

Ideally, you’d profit if it goes back to the $0.10 range. Worst case scenario, you break even.

One really good thing is that it’s not in the mainstream media like doge, shiba, pepe, even bonk. This means it doesn’t have too much visibility yet, so you’re relatively early.

But yea, I’d average it down.
