I actually had to fact check this.

Both Nigeria and India are highly corrupt and they face a lot of regulation challenges. But this report is based on data from Chainalysis, which is a reputable blockchain analytics firm.

To me it looked super contradictory, especially considering both countries have been pushing exchanges out of their territories.

In India, there’s a lot of restrictive policies like high taxes and bans on foreign exchanges, but crypto activity is very high. Indian users bypass restrictions, so there’s high trading activity they recur to DeFi.

I also found that recently some exchanges that were banned (Binance), have re-registered in India, which is a sign of regulatory changes I guess.

The same goes for Nigeria, when it comes to challenges like banning crypto transactions through banks. And yet adoption still happens through p2p trading platforms.

So even though governments make it almost impossible to use crypto, their citizens turn to crypto due to things like inflation, lack of financial inclusion, and investment opportunities. The people are carrying!

So yea, the data is reliable.
