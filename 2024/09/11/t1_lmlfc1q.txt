I think a donuts cap would have been more effective.

u/BigRon1977 is right, with a 50 comment cap newcomers will be penalised, since people/farmers will only make sure to tip the ones with an high score that are more likely tipping them back.

the only active people on this sub are farmers, and farmers will do that in order to maximise the farming
