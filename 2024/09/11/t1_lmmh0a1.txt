if you don't get a reply before the post is snapshotted (like 48h from the date you make it), nothing really matters since you lose the tips bonuses and pay the pay2post fee, and even if they re-approve the post you lost it all.

I also am on the queue with 3 modmails, one from 2 months ago, another one from 2 weeks ago and another one today ðŸ«
