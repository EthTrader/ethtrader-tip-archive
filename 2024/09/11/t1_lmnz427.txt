Internet has tangible utility for every single person everywhere. You need a connection and device and then you can use it. 

ETH needs users to have connection and device, knowledge to operate in this universe (wallet, defi, dex, cex, “not your keys not your coins”, etc.) and then find another user with the aforementioned. That’s the largest hurdle to adoption. 

 The average consumer is an idiot. Even the above average consumer is an idiot. They’re all also lazy. So if the barriers are too high, they simply won’t bother. That’s what’s missing.
