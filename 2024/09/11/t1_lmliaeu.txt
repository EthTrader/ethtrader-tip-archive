you are totally right, but these are free internet magic money and farmers will farm. And in order to maximise the farming, they(/we) will tip more the people that can tip back with higher chances and weight.

it is already happening if you pay enough attention, people with no weight or newcomers take a lot less tips than others.

you want less farming? let's just stop donut distribution and keep only contrib distribution

I might be cynical, but I don't think there is any other way to prevent the farmers from farming free money, even if you keep calling "a few cents"
