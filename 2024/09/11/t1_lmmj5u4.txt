I really don't understand how posts like this are off topic. A little earlier today the mods removed my post that only talked about numbers in crypto. 1000% macroeconomics, but they blocked it with the argument that it doesn't apply to this sub and it's not on topic. And this happens to me every other day.

WOW!
