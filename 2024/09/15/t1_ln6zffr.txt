Exactly. I've seen a lot of people be critical about the lack of new users and it's the same group of people; but the fact is, it's not just this sub. That's just a trend across Reddit right now.

The fact we are still sustaining this rank with 'less users' means there are less users on all the other subs too.

For us regulars, it seems quiet, especially anyone that joined Reddit during 2020/21 - but that was when the markets were at peak Euphoria as well.

Subs were pretty quiet in 2019 and 2020 before COVID too.
