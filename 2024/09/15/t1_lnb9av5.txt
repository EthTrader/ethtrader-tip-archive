It´s a very old rule. Means that you can´t copy more than 25% of the link news article. 

My post yesterday also got deleted because I quoted 3 sentences and added the source: Reason new Rule: Post need more than 200 words... I loved to quote a bit from the article but that´s RIP now.

Just add the link address as link and you will be safe.
