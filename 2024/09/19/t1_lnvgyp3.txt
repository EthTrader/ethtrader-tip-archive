>An Ethereum ICO participant moved 10,000 ETH to Kraken after two years of dormancy, selling it for $24.37 million. The wallet, which participated in Ethereum's ICO nine years ago, originally received 50,000 ETH. This sale is part of a trend of dormant whales selling their holdings, raising concerns about market impacts. Ethereum's price has shown weakness, partly due to these sales and disappointing ETF inflows

With all this sell, I don't think we'll ever gonna bounce back soon. It'll take long
