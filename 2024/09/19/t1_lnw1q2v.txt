honestly, I sell my donuts (like all the other free money I earn around) regardless of the price, since my only strategy is to increase my BTC and ETH bags every time I get the chance.

Over the past 8 years I've spent in this industry, I've learnt one should always stick to their plan, not trying to time the market, and so far it has been doing great for me ðŸ™ƒ
