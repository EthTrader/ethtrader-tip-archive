I have a few skeptical remarks / questions.

* Why would I buy a car using ETH? What benefit does that provide to myself or the car seller?
* I can't imagine my grandparents investing in crypto. Do you really think retired people will have an interest in this & fuel a bull run?
* Gas fees are already relatively low since Dencun. It also made ETH inflationary again. I'd scratch the "very" in "very limited" supply.

Utility needs to be the reason for demand & I wonder which things we will be able to do with ETH. What will become possible or easier? There probably are/will be opportunities & functions I don't yet understand but so far I've not yet experienced one concrete real life benefit of owning ETH. Hope this will soon become apparent to me.
