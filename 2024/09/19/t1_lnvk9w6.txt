Bricks are going to continue to be a random money maker for some.

It's the perfect crypto to pump n dump.

It's listed on Kraken, so it has sufficient liquidity.

It's a low cap, so it's price can be swayed.

It's got no supply inflation.

If it doesn't move for 2-3 weeks, it's probably worth throwing $50 or $100 into xD
