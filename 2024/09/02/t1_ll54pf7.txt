>You shouldn't even tell anyone you're investing in crypto no matter you're making money or losing it. 

>If you lose people will make fun of you. If you get rich, they'll ask for money.

It's not even about telling anyone you make it from crypto... It's about not telling anyone anything about you no matter what. Telling people about you will make you vulnerable. Keep things secret and people will respect you and they'll always be curious about what you're doing
