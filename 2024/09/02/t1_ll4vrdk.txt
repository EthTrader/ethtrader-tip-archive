>Question: Do you think sunset will help moons in long run?

Absolutely. huge FUD after the sunset announcement, but once it was established that the contract would be burned and not "self destrcted" - it was a huge game changer that really makes it the "Bitcoin of RCP's"

I never believed for a second MOON was going to hit $1 before the sunset... but, now, I'm super confident it will due to the sunset followed by a moon rise xD
