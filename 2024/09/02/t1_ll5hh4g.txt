yup, 6 months ago, on my birthday ðŸ« 

thank God it was my "play with" wallet, so not the main one where I hodl the real thing, but still I lost like 0.37 eth and same value of Bitcones, both high in price at that time ðŸ« 

it wasn't easy to move forward, but the cone sub really helped me with tips and sympathy ðŸ§¡
