> I think the sunset was bad at first but was good on a long term

After the sunset, and the immediate emotion settled down, there were 3 scenarios which could have played out.

1) Reddit transfers the contract to probably JWinterm - Moons continue on, under new ownership

2) Reddit renounces/burns the contract - tokens remain with no more changes/minting etc

3) Reddit self destructs the contract and tokens and they become completely unusable

2 out of 3 scenarios were good, 1 was bad.
