Perhaps there should also be clear rules around it as well.

For example.

Blockchain evidence that shows loss of donuts. Rather than somebody 'forgetting their seed'

Perhaps the burning of some donuts as a way of an "admin fee" as well.

And something like a minimum rounds of participation just to eliminate a bunch of new accounts experiencing "incidents" even if they were trying to somehow game a system of sorts.
