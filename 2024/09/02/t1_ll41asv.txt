nope... I mean, it was my Reddit vault but I did sell all my donuts cause I was pissed at this sub, so I withdrew my LP position and swapped all the donuts for another token.

while bridging/doing so, I signed a malicious contract 🥺

lost 0.37 Weth + another token worth the same USD value 🫠

thank God I was able to save my avatars, worth even more at that time, sending all of them to u/Fredzoor, he saved me❤️

saddest part of it all, it is that it happens the day of my birthday 🫠

you live, you learn I guess
