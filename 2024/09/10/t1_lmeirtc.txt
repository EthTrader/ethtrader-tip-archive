I'm not so sure about that either, since the number of distributed Donuts is fixed, and we all are posting news link.

I mean, if many bronuts had switched to OG flaired posts or technical/discussion I could have seen a decrease in received Donuts, but I think that's not the case, I see pretty much the same number of "non link" post on the sub as before this rule ðŸ¤”
