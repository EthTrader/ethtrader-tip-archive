I don't know, I'm not sure it will work how you say, especially if the cap would be set at like 15k per distro, in which case farmers will keep commenting but waaay less since they know the can achieve those 15k cap with half their effort, since more effort brings no extra earnings (this was happening in r/cc with moons too, working pretty well imo).

plus, this spam for pennies thing, it's not true.
Take me for example, I spend 2h per day on Reddit, and only the 40% of the time is on this sub.y any earning is 25k Donuts per distro, that sometimes it translated in $400
the "good" part is that I'm taking this time here during my *FiatNam* so that's an easy incentive to keep the farming alive

I'm not sure to be able to write my thoughts on this in a clear way since I sometomes struggle writing in English, but that's how things are for most of the Ethtrader farmers in my opinion
