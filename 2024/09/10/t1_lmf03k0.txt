The main difference is the connection to the main chain.

L2s are build directly on top of the main chain (ETH) inheriting its security and other features.

Sidechains are separate blockchains that connect to the main chain (ETH) using bridges. They can have their own consensus and mechanism independent from main chain.

Personally I prefer L2s.
