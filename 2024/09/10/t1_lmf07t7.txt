That's a big hope. I don't think the people buying ETFs get the "self-control" use case of crypto nor are they interested in the same. They want their assets managed. They don't want the responsibility associated with self custody. This is why the ETFs exist in the first place - so companies & individuals can have crypto exposure without the "headache". Might also be easier legally in some cases.
