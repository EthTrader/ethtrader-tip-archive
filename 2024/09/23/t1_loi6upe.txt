Man, that's a complicated question! So, I used AI to answer this one for me, I punched the liquidity pool data in and here what it says!

Approximately 15,187,401 DONUT would need to be dumped, with no buy orders, to get the price down to 0.001.... however I have not factored in how many DONUTs are in the Uniswap liquidity pool on Mainnet - that would increase the answer.
