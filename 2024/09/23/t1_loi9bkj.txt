Which is funny, the most recent proposal I made was back in July, and that sought to eliminate all those old news articles, some which contained outdated and incorrect information that people were posting. And before that most of mine were about awarding more CONTRIB to users and balancing flair multipliers xD

All these "confusing" rules have been proposed by others!

Funnily enough, It's probably been about 2 months since I started to get targetted xD
