I feel like YES you're right but cryptopunks has no utilities and no royalties which makes it's hodlers receive every ETH they sell it for. I think that's why people are still bullish on it and the reason for it hype. 

And YEAH you're right about the laundering of money too but I feels like YUGA'S BAYC is more of that than pixel punks
