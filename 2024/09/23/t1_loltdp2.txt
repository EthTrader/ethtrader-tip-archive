>Just for logging in, you get 300 coins each day. If you're going to play Pixels regularly, then this is a great way to get ahead. The game doesn't tell you this anywhere that I can findâ€”you just have to stumble upon it by going to your Pixels dashboard.

Not my type of game. I'd get bored in 2 days.
