Imo there’s just too few people here, people talk about ‘quality’ but how can there be quality all day long when there’s only 27 members who get more than 100 donuts in an entire week (aka 27 active daily members) ?

Of course we are going to have less quality than r/cc, I checked out their csv recently and thousands qualified for moon distribution compared to 200-300 on EthTrader- they have at least 10x the amount of active members
