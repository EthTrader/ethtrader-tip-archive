It’s not that people don’t tip, people don’t like to engage on OG post because .. wait for it.. they actually have to spend time to read an OG post

I had multiple airdrop and NFT posts which didn’t even have 10 other comments in it (outside of my tips and replies) which is literally 1/3 or 1/4 the engagement I’d get from a 10 second link post
