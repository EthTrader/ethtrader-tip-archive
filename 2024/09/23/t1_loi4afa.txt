Well, I think him and Carl don’t want to vote against the community if the numbers indicate that the vast majority wants a certain change. Looking at the numbers, it is so clear that we want this change so my guess is they don’t want to intrude.

Maybe the fact this isn’t the first time it’s proposed either, has him accepting the communitys stance

That’s just how I see it but I could be wrong.
