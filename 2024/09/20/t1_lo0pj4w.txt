you'll see, nothing will change in the top 20 earners, we are going to earn even more, I'm ready to bet 5k donuts on it 😁

why?

'cause this sub is made by 20 active users tipping each other, so the comment cap will only lead to users better choose who to tip, to make sure they 'll be tipped back 🙃

this proposal could have effect in a sub with a decent activity
