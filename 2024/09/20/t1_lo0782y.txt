>At 4 AM (SGT) on Sept 20, our team detected abnormal access to the BingX hot wallet, suspecting a hacker attack. We immediately initiated an emergency response, including asset transfers and pausing withdrawals.

ðŸ”’ Only minor losses so far, and weâ€™ve got it covered. Most assets are safe in cold wallets, with only a small portion affected in the hot wallet.

To protect user funds, weâ€™re extending recharge & withdrawal times while reinforcing security. Coins will be processed within 24 hours. Weâ€™re sorry for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding!
