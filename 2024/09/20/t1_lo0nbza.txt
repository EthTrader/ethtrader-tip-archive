yeah, in a ideal world you 'd be right

but facts are a bit different ðŸ˜‚

look at what has been happening so far with all the new rules... top earners earning more and more every distro 

I started here with 6/12k donuts per month, and nowy AVG is 25k, and I didn't changed or increased my time in here

all these extra donuts we are earning, are less donuts for other people, this is facts

a donuts cap would have been more efficient imo
