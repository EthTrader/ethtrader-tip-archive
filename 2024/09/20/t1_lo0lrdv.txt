>To address this issue, I propose introducing a cap on the number of comments per user that are eligible to earn Donuts, every 24 hours.

*Users would still be free to comment beyond this limit, but only the first 50 comments would be eligible to earn*

This cap would encourage users to focus on the quality of their comments, rather than the quantity, thus creating a more balanced and just ecosystem for everyone.
