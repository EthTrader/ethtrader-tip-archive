Na the game is shit I wouldn't even call it a game lol 

Basically tap to upgrade stuff but it's not really time consuming. It does have other stuff you can do that is time consuming like downloading other games to get keys and stuff 

If you're on the internet all the time like we all are I wouldn't fade these telegram games may as well give them a go 

Cats is even easier it just has tasks which normally consist of joining another telegram group and that's it. I join get the cats then leave 

Dogs was the same model as cats and plenty got a few 100 $ out of it just for a few taps a day
