Myself, Matt and Basoosh at least have been actively developing the ecosystem.

These things take time, and the results take even longer. I'm not alone, fortunately. Some devs, like Mattg and Basoosh, have been great pillars in the development of the Donut ecosystem.

The problem is that people only think about themselves and the money they earned for free. The only way they track progress is through a potential Cex listing, but they don't understand the HUGE bureaucracy and factors associated with this process.

Yes, listing is in our plans. Yes, we have discussed this internally several times. Yes, we already communicated directly with several exchanges. When we think it makes sense for DONUT, it will happen.
