I don’t know but my guess is that the exchange is still working doing some updates.

Yesterday I  had MATIC balance but I couldn’t do anything with it. Today I checked my portfolio and I have no MATIC but a ”new” POL token.

Mind you, not on Kraken but my guess is that you just have to wait for them to update things. Hold tight.
