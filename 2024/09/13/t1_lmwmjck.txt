1. Ethereum's downturn has started long before ETH spot ETFs were a thing.
2. Not a big fan of TA but ok, I believe you.
3. THAT is the main reason imo. It is never a good sign when lead figures demonstrate a lesser belief in their project. Whatever Vitalik / Ethereum Foundation needed money for, I bet there were other options to raise funds.
4. Valid point. There's a lot of competition in this market nowadays.
5. Tokenomics. Surprised they were not mentioned. Since shortly after the Dencun upgrade, ETH is inflationary again. This is also when it's downtrend started.
