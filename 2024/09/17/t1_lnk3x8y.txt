Notging special. Yesterday was pretty slow daily. But today itÂ´s active. Will post a governance poll proposal today to punish poeple participating in governance week who just hold 1 Donut and get full vote bonus. Like weight system if you hold 50k/50k you get 100% bonus, but if you have less Donuts, you get a bit less % seen from governance.
