My interpretation: The "Original Content" flair is applicable when a post contains 500+ words of meaningful information as to encourage serious discussion. "OC" posts should primarily consist of objective data, original or inspired ideas, thorough analysis and research, but can include subjective discussion that is relative to objective data/evidence presented. Plagiarized and AI generated posts are not eligible for the Original Content flair.

Someone posting 500 words analyzing charts and providing factual information and data is very different to someone writing 500 words saying of sentiment or self story or trading questions.
