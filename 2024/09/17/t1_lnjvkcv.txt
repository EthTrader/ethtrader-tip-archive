For season 1 it depends when you started. 
There were points caps per day, so many people had to do 130+ transactions a day to stay in the highest two levels. If you started a week or two into S1 then even hitting the points caps every day I don't think it would be worth it because of the gas fees over time, and the likely low rewards. 
S2 starts today, and the Taiko team is doing an AMA so people can get details about how exactly S2 works. Getting in on day 1 for S2 might be worth it, if you're planning to stick it out for those 3 months.
Also doing all those transactions every day took a fair amount of time. I have a decent amount of free time, so for me putting some of that time into Taiko S1 was worth it, but I don't think I'd recommend it for someone who doesn't have that much free time.
