*The latest reports in the industry suggest that all five SEC Commissioners will testify before the House Financial Services Committee next week. This development comes at a time when the SEC chair Gary Gensler has been facing a probe for illegal hiring at the agency. With the SEC launching an investigation into the ETH security status, market analysts are curious about whether this debate will prop up again next week.*

So based on the article above from the post, seems like Gary has been into some illegal hiring at the SEC. Sounds unrelated to the ETH security thing but more on his methods on hiring employees legally. This will really put a dent on the SEC.
