> I'm still worried about activity

Activity is down in cryptocurrency subs in general. Despite our "low activity" we are still hovering around rank 5th in cryptocurrency subs, which includes Bitcoin, r/cc and coinbase.

Yes, it's sad there arn't hundreds of new users joining each week, but that's the case for all the subs.

The people who are still here, and still in r/cc are those who have invested a lot, or still have a LOT of conviction on both crypto and community tokens.

Casuals will return, as will a new generation of crypto users when  the markets actually get to that exciting stage, and not just for us, but exciting enough to enourage new investors.
