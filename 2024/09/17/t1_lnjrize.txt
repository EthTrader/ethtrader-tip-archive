I know its not personal, but I'm already got a warning a few days ago about posting Ondo though it is in Ethereum blockchain. 

So, I'm already confused because what I thought was allowed. I want clarity should I post only about Ethereum/macro news or can put other L2s.


>theres a lot of spam and low quality in comparison to r/CryptoCurrency - 5 out of 10 articles are either shills or dumb crap 

Remember, here we are only limited to post Ethereum ecosystem and macro news. In r/CC, you have a lot of other coins to post.
