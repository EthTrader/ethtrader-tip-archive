Agree. Competition, however, is good, and no doubt what we will see is the top 5 Rollups stand tall above the rest, and some of the less popular ones will die off.

That said, there is a place for both ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups which would be better suited for slightly different reasons and projects.
