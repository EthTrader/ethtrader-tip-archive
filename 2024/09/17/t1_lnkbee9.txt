Cool! Ambient looks like something i would use, especially the limit order. Just had a quick view in the docs and really cool that the whole DEX is in a single smart contract that is changing the way of how a DEX works completely, im pretty amazed.

And looked at a quick video explaining Tranchess, thats just really wild haha. I need some more research about that before i will dive in. But it sure looks interesting! 

Thanx for sharing!
