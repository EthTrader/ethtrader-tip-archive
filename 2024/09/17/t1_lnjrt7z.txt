But that proves my point even further because if in r/CryptoCurrency the discussion is broader then there should be more shills and low quality stuff about other coins which isnt the case. Quality there has nothing to do with here Im sorry but tahts the truth. We are way more people there than here and its not as annoying there. Here its the same people over and over again posting dumb shit most of the time. Just a rant ROFL been holding this for too long !tip 1
