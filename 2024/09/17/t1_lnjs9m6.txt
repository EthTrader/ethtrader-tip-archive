I agree with the adoption being already here (even tho no the mass type yet), and I agree on point 1.

Plus if you look at the huge companies investing in BTC and ETH, it's undeniable.

  
But I don't think point 2 is that true. I mean that weird man just want to squeeze people to get more millions, not sure how pro-crypto he really is
