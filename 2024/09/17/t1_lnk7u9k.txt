There are way too many Layer 2 solutions, imo.

What happens when thereâ€™s way more supply than demand, the ecosystem becomes overwhelmed and over competitive. This also creates more fragmentation than scalability.

The market is already super saturated. Not all of them will last, and only a few chains will stay relevant.
