Time for another *3 month long* Taiko season.

Remember all those rules from season 1? The rules that had people asking the same questions over and over again in their discord because no one read the medium posts? Well they decided to just about triple the amount of rules haha. 

Yeah I'm not happy about it, but I'm still gonna do it.
