Imo We should incentivize hodling by getting a bit more… Creative. Let’s think outside the box more

One example could be new Governance Score tresholds. Atm we only have 20K for full weight and 60k for approving posts. 

Atm it’s a bit stale for those of Us with way over 60K. Let’s have some more cool and creative things to do if we hold for example 150K, 300K, 500K and 1 million.

We need more goals to work towards. It’s a bit stale atm. All we have is the voting power, which ofc is nice. But way more things could be added imo.
