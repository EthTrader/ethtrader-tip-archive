I tell you my story: I found Moons because I have googled a lot how to get free crypto. I wasn´t a member of reddit till then. I made this account and started to be very active, like I always was. The result was that I was banned from the sub. Reason: Upvote manipulation, Voting manipulation. They were so wrong. They couldn´t even explain, because I never had alts.

I mailed them, that this was a mistake and told them that I´m new and not an alt. They muted me for 1 month.

Then they sunsetted the project.

I will never again visit this sub.
