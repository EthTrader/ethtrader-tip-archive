I mean you are right. My biggest worry was mods who would dump their moons even before they reached $1. Some of them had +1million moons back then. That would crash the liquidity.

Btw do people still earn moons there? Like can they still sell it? It's been a few years since I got banned and sold all of my moons unfortunately. I think I must have a couple hundreds moons left in my wallet.
