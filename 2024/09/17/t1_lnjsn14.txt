Dude I was always approaching moons with hesitation. I was there since 2020. A part of me believed that moons were going to a few dollars and maybe $10 at some point but another part of me was like, what if they dump this project? I was a big believer in moons. I sold all my moons at some point because of their mods. They banned me for no reason and didn't even talk to me. they were so annoying. So I sold my moons out of anger. I didn't sell them at top. but it was a fair price I believe. If they didn't ban me, I would hold them forever.
