i am not that active in the sub anymore so i dont know how fair or unfair the current distribution is ... 

From what i know people who can make more comments will be against that rule and people who cant make that many comment will be in favor of that rule .. each to their own..

As far i remember , donut distro was always like that i remember top earner used to look like this 60k , 55k , 35k , 30k and then bunch of people with 20k to 30k donuts .. this is even with the high prices ..

i dont know much about the current distro so i dont have a say on that
