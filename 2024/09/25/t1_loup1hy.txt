>How long is the current membership valid?

Season I lasts for a total of 56 days. 28 days left until Season II.

>Does every round renew?

You have to subscribe every round. So every new season you'd need to mind a new membership card (NFT).

>I thought it was two months old.

That's the duration of seasons, correct.
