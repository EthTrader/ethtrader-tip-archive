>Okay so it can be that 25 comments are tipped and 25 are not and then the daily cap is reached.

You got it, yes that's right.

>Even only ‚tip 1’ are counting as a comment, right?

I'm going to clarify this detail with the devs. Technically shouldn't count but not sure if that's incorporated into the code.

Assuming it's not, it's a lot more work. Either way I'll get an accurate answer soon.
