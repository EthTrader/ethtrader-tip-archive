>50 comment rule worked really great on CC because [](https://www.reddit.com/r/cc/) is a really wide topic , any form of crypto topic can be discussed .. thats why its so big , its has nothing to do with those certain rules .. meanwhile ETHtrader is a specific topic and a branch of cryptocurrency which is limit on number of topics that can be discussed...
