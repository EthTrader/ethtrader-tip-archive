people says 90% of the users we had before T2V were alts, but I think that way exaggerated.

While is true we lost several unique and interesting users while we (me) farmers still earn like before, or even more, like you said.

I agree with you, sub not looking good and T2V system is a pretty bad implementation that mods and "non farmers" bronuts keep repeating saved the sub ðŸ«
