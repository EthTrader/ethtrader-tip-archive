There is no rule about the Contrib reimbursement and mods/devs have no control over it unless its put to vote. Any individual who wants to have it done should make a Poll stating their situation and request for the new Contrib.

I'm surprised why didn't Rik and Prog request it. If they want they can still do it. The community will definitely support it.
