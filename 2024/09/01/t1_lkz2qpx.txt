Well I wouldn't say you're wrong though. The over hype price for apes and punk is annoying and that clearly money laundering but they're still some good NFTs out there with better utility. The sandbox, Ethereum Name Service, and even ethtrader card for premium membership is a great idea but the truth is, the ones with good utilities will not be popular.

The ones for money laundering are just over hyped shit that turns lots people to exit liquidity :(
