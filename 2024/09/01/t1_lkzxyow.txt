If I check DONUT on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc0f9bd5fa5698b6505f643900ffa515ea5df54a9) or [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xf42e2b8bc2af8b110b65be98db1321b1ab8d44f5), it has 5873 / 1443 holders respectively.

The possible incentive to sell isn't happy meals imo. It is opportunity cost. What you hold in DONUT, you can't hold in ETH or BTC or Nvidia stocks at the same time. If someone believes to know a better investment out there, anything will be sold to obtain more of it, regardless of how low the asset in question might currently stand.
