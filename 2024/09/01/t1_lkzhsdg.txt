One of the big problems is the link spam - but as you said. "camraderie" - and thats an issue as well.

Meanwhile, we have a user, that has been writing and publishing their own weekly recap of Ethereum news, for 8 years. They don't engage in comment spamming across the sub, so most people don't even know who they are... they almost never get 3 tips per post.
