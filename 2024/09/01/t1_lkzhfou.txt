> Before T2V more than 90% of the ‘new users’ were just alt accounts and ShitNuts anyway

This. One of the larger obstacles for new comers to r/ethtrader was also registering a defi wallet. Compare that to r/cc, before the sunset, you could create vault from within the reddit app itself.

r/cc is a huge sub compared to us, and still relying on upvotes; but they only have about 7k users on their CSV, but pre-sunset, there was 20-30k users!

Most of these crypto subs, especially those with active/registered wallets are defintely more invested users and farmers, rather than the casual/seasonal user.
