It's very easy to vote yes, simply because we know the user, who has been very active and around a long time, and while it could set a precedent, it's not really something that can be gamed. II don't mind voting on this as a case by case basis.

What's the worst that can happen, someone in the future tries to do something similar, but disingenuously, but they still need to buy more DONUT to get the CONTRIB to have any worth anyway.
