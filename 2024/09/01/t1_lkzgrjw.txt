I have a theory

Before T2V more than 90% of the ‘new users’ were just alt accounts and ShitNuts anyway

So T2V didn’t actually change anything in terms of making EthTrader less attractive. It just eliminated the ShitNuts

Anyway I am sure it is worth it because I think it is no coincidence at all that the average amount of donuts for the top 30 earners has increased substantially after T2V was implemented - the ShitNuts have been nuked !!
