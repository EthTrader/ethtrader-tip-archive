I don't think the quantity of news will decrease, we will just have more people posting.

Again, for me the whole problem is the pay2post system.

Users are "forced" to tip other users like a big "camaraderie" so they don't lose üç© donuts for posting.

Comments on posts are like one liners and a tip.

Some news don't even have much space to discuss to begin with.
