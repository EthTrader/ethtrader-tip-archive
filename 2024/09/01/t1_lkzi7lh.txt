It is, but it still requires users to actively know how and be confident in DeFi.

So many people on r/cc for example, would open a vault, but when they finally wanted to sell MOON, they were so lost... needed lots of help on understanding metamask and what to do.

There would be plenty of people who have crypto and only hold on a CEX, so DeFi and having their own wallet address is new to them still.
