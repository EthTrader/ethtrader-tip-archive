>In fact, I cannot understand those who only sell when the price dumps

I sell on a monthly basis regardless the price, to buy me some sats and eth. Is not that I'm selling something that I paid for![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)

I like easy strategy, and mine is turn everything into BTC and ETH each month. Been doing this since 2017 and I can tell it's the best thing to do for me
