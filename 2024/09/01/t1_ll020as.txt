Hmm. I suspect it might be with the way AMBCrypto actually format their website; they seem to have more of a " scrolling feed" rather than redirecting to a new page. With a scrolling feed, that could mean when they publish a new article, the most recent article becomes on top.

When I scroll down, I the URL changes.

So, perhaps instead of the link you think you are copying, it defaults back to the top of the page, which is a different URL.  


Notice on the screenshot, I have only scrolled down, not clicked any new link.
