It is possible but you need the altcoin and shitcoin market to be really good and in full swing like 2021

It takes lots of billions of dollars to pump big alts 10x from here and reach their old ATHs. So it’s definitely possible for Donuts to break its ATH because much less money is needed to do that compared to other coins

As for my top 3, I think other BroNuts will recommend coins that will give higher returns. But if you want to know 3 coins I’ve been buying, Doge, Link and Donuts. I think there are riskier coins that will give higher returns but these are the coins that suit my risk appetite for now (downside limited to 20%, but upside slightly less compared to other shitcoins)
