Story Time!

The evil manipulating Kirtash created new wallets and a new account on an exchange and created a story in which he got scammmed.

Now, he's trying to get more CONTRIB minted on a new wallet.

Then, when the dust has settled, he will slowly send those DONUT back to his original wallet, and also buy DONUT in his new wallet.

All of a sudden, BAM, Kirtash and his "alt wallet" now has over 1 million CONTRIB.

He plans to rule this sub with an iron fist!!

But, we don't mind, coz he buys 500k DONUT and pumps the price back to 1 cent.

:D
