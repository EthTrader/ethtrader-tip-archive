It depends on a number of factors

If we see a shitcoin season in 2025 the same scale of 2021 where many shitcoins were above 100m market cap and ScamMoon could reach 3B market cap, I think by default Donuts can reach 10 cents

But if that doesnâ€™t happen we might need to be more conservative. If almost all the big alts still do a 10-20x and break their 2021 ATHs I still see Donuts breaking the latest high this year and breaking 6.9 cents
