Been here for around a month and I was initially put off by all the rules since they didn’t exist on any other subreddit. Once I started tapping into the posts of this group though, I realized there’s a lot of value I can take away from the group of people here.

Maybe if some rules are eased, like being unable to post GIF’s on comments, as an example…this would make the group more open to newbies who check in on occasion and can react to posts as they see fit.
