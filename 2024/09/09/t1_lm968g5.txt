None of that is our fault though, inflation is all government and they've done a fair job at deflecting responsibility. My family had different opportunities and they were better, free university, a house for £8000 and free healthcare. Each one of those is gone now, the NHS may as well be vetenary care at this point. It's their fault but we can't do a thing so 🤷‍♀️
