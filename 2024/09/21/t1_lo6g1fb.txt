>Most of eths active users are outside of etherum and not attracting price gain to etherum. What’s the point of being happy l2 are being used when they are generating very little for eth.

Not everything is about moving the price. Its about building a huge ecosystem that uses ETH on the bottom while making it cheaper to use for whatever on the top layers.

>If people left Layers 2 and transacted on eth it would be even more expensive to transfer than it was in 2021 wouldn’t it? I’m honestly do not know but I was trading micro caps eth plays earlier this year and it costed $50-$100 to send any eth anywhere.

Yes, I experienced that too and it is a pain. I think ETH should address cheap gas fees in L1. Currently solved a lot of problems with blobs feature on L2s but L1 must be solved too.
