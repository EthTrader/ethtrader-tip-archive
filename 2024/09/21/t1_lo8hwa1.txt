The big gains were already achieved on Pepe. It’s already a mainstream token.

But that doesn’t mean you can’t swing trade it and get some good profits as well.

I personally held from 0.000006 until ~0.00001, and reallocated profits to another play already.

Right now I’m considering buying back, and aim for ~0.000009, as that seems like an achievable target to me. Waiting for a little dip to cash in.
