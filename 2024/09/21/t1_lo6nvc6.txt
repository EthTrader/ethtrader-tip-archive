Trading thread is a great shout! I agree with your sentiment; This could be beneficial for the sub growth. Makes no sense to have the Discord such a big ”part” of ethtrader imo. 

The sub should be the core focus, be it trading, news, ”behind the scenes” stuff and important ethtrader developments. 

Some of us are not interested in the Discord drama group. Sadly that means missing out on information.
