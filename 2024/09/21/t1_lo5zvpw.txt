ETHFI, EIGEN, BLAST in particular I'm enjoying their subsequent seasons.

BLAST, despite having done just 1 transaction, I'm sitting in the top 8500 wallets, simply because i'm staking ETH and earning rewards. I anticipate, I'll get atleast another $100 worth of BLAST tokens when the S2 ends.

ETHFI/EIGEN is the same, token rewards for simply staking and earning more ETH.
