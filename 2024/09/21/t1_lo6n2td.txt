True but I guess it's better to do it like this. Yes we wants adoption but they needs to limit the marketing. People tends to try and gain and that might leads to pump and dump. If they market it too much to the public, lots of newbies might lose money and they'll blame SONY for their lost.

It's better to keep the name and the brand that has been doing well for years than lossing it credibility just because of a Blockchain they releases on ETH
