The thing about memecoins is that it’s usually more dangerous / rewarding in early stages.

After they’ve gained market maturity, it gets “easier” to trade. Of course there’s still some degree of risk, but that’s crypto.

Memecoins in the top leaderboard are usually good trades. I don’t endorse holding them, though. Get in and get out.
