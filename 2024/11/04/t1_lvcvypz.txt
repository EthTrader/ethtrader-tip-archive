>I think something like that has been applied in the CC subreddit and had positive impact. (it was only for holding moons for 1 month tho)

If I dont remember wrong it was a multiplier calculated based on moons earned and in wallet at the snapshot moment no matter what. This is why people used to sell after distribution and buy back before snapshot.

I am in favor, even if I lost it all during the hack, 2 months have passed since day so time to keep earning the bonus.

>This will require some development to verify each wallet transaction since 2 months ago, do the math required between in/out donut and if the balance is >=0 at the day of snapshot, the user is eligible for the bonus. This way this rule wont punish traders.

This consulting service just cost you 50k DONUT. I accept only crypto payments /s
