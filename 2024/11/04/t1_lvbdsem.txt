Remove some of the rules. Unban users who did nothing wrong

When people have complained about new users not coming because of so many rules I've seen mods respond saying farmers just want it easier

It couldn't be any easier with all these rules xD it keeps new users away whilst those already here know how to navigate them

The data speaks for itself the sub is dead
