I think this is well summed up.

I'd like to add that as with any utility project, there's only so much coin one can realistically utilize. The speculation with the token often far exceeds the amounts people would need for all their interactions with all the dapps build on the ecosystem. In that sense I think many utility projects are overbought.

Lastly there is the Ethereum Foundation, undoubtedly a great driver behind the innovation OP has mentioned. But for the foreseeable future they will remain an ETH seller in order to finance themselves. This will keep selling pressure on the token & it doesn't exactly inspire investor confidence in others.

So while innovation in Ethereum keeps moving forward, the ETH coin is stuck in reverse.
