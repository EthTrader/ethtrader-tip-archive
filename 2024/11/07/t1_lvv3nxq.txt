Oh finally I found this guys - 

Trump pledged to fire Securities and Exchange Commission sec chair gary gensler on the first day of his Presidency.

He said - On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler,” Trump famously said. However, it's questionable as to whether the President actually has the power to fire the SEC chair.😂😂

It is a slap on his face
