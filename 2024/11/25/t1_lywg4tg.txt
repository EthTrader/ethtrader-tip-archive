Bitcoin is still the mainstream coin, mainly because of its market maturity and the fact that it was the first crypto ever created. It's the number one in market cap and is the most recognized, even among people who aren’t actively involved in the industry.

That’s why when it comes to public statements, campaigns, or pro-crypto endorsements, Bitcoin is always the main subject.

Tons of people, especially those less involved in crypto, still don’t know about Ethereum. I've asked people if they’re familiar with Bitcoin, and they recognize it. But when I ask them about Ethereum, most don’t know what it is.

Big institutions already have their eyes on Ethereum. We’re currently in a slow accumulation phase, and these institutions are getting ready to capitalize on their holdings once Ethereum truly goes mainstream.
