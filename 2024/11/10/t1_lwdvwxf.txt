Sometimes I feel that I should gamble my money when I know 100% what was gonna happen. It was 100% clear to me who would win the elections due to some facts that I am not going to write to prevent a chance of Reddit ban (Unfortunately we still live in a world that some things matter when voting for some people).

Why I have to have a personality that doesn't handle risk well even if I am 100% sure? Damn! I am made to be poor!

Regarding the administration, we will never know if they would have changed their point of view on crypto which I believe it would have happen one way or another.

However I believe that at the same time that market cycles are sacred, politics cycles are sacred too. According to what I believe right wing winning is part of the politics cycle and same will happen in Europe too. In this case politics cycles are a delayed wheel where the party coming on power eats the mistakes of the previous one xD

Anyway, economy should improve now during the right wing administration, not because of them. Just because of the previous one. Then things will go south and left wing will manage it, and repeat.
