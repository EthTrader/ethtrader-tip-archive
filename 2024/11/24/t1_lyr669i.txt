My take on AI is that it can analyze large volumes of data in real time which I guess can help to try to predict market trends and help traders - AI algorithms can also detect fraud patterns so thats a plus for security. Over relying on AI is not a good thing because tech can fail and be manipulated and if used incorrectly AI can expose sensitive data !tip 1
