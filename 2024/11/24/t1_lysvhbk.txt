Yes sir! You 'migrated' as well ey?

Why have we just replaced the cool customer emotes we had? Not even kept a single one of them?

I see we have added a new one that there is supposed to be a governance proposal about becoming the new donut logo. Seems a bit weird to replacing the other ðŸ”¥ emotes with a new one which has just been proposed...

I know it's only emotes but this happens just after me saying yesterday that we already have scalable ðŸ”¥ donut emotes so there is no need for this new donut logo ðŸ¤£ The timing of shit around here is always highly suspicious
