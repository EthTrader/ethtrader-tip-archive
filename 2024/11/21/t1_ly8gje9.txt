>Last cycle, BTC broke its all-time high (ATH) around November 2020 and hit 2x that level (around $40k) by February 2021. Meanwhile, ETH was lagging—it was sitting at about $620, which was -50% from its previous ATH in November 2020. ETH didn’t break its ATH until February 2021, after BTC had already doubled. And even when ETH finally broke through, it dipped -50% again before pumping to new highs

So history repeats itself? GOT IT

It means ETH gonna rise next February
