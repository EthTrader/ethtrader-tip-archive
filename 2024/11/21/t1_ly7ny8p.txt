I am not 100% sure, but the same analysis from the mods which got the group banned should still show bad results here.

I consider all tips to compute these percentages the mods just looked at tips to the top contributers to compute their percentages and since the first 3 names are mostly always belong to the top 10, numbers should look bad on the mod end.

I still think it's because of the small user base but mod analysis wise here should be people flagged. Would be nice if they would publish their data for this round, without banning people obviously.
