>I would blame it on the Layer 2's actually. Every L2 seems to be focused on growing their TVL and fighting for user base. And they do all these with speculation of Airdrops.

ETH problem is instead of making your gas fees lower and faster from the very beginning, you make it higher and slower which is why Solana did the opposite.

If ETH has been cheaper in transactions and faster like the Layer2, solana and Binance smartchain will just be like XRP, stellar lumens etc (that won't be relevant to be called an eth killer)

But both are doing almost pretty much what ETH is doing with a cheaper and faster transactions :(
