Let's not forget, following SBF and the FTX saga, SOL was one of the hardest hit alts, having lost a lot of value. Making it's recovery result in a pretty high percentage gain over the last 18 months.

This of course, doesn't take away what SOL offers, but, perhaps it would not be talked bout so much if SOL didn't dump as hard as it did during the winter.

It will be interesting to watch the next 6 months take place.
