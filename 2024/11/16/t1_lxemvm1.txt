Where are the governance polls regarding the last 2 mods CONTRIB migration?

Sometimes it can be interesting to play the "decentralized" game in an smart way. Just play the game, do the governance polls, vote because they will pass with a \[YES\] and people wont notice that mods can do whatever xD

Not angry or against about this, just pointing the obvious. If you need an external consultant regarding this kind of topics to maintain the decentralization game on check feel free to hire me. I am quite cheap, we can discuss prices in private.
