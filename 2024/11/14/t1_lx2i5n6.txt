> Damn 4 years to break even is horrible lol

On the flipside; what would have been a better play; would have been to convert all my CRO cashback received into BTC at the end of every month - would have broken even MUCH sooner... I'll learn from this mistake this cycle.

As I said, I'm always going to be spending money on food, petrol, clothes, beer. So, from hear on out, every CRO earned for the rest of my life is pure profit xD
