The card is a long term users play IMO.

I enjoy it; but I also bought enough CRO to get the Ruby Red tier, and then when the price of CRO increased, and my built up CRO cashback, I was able to upgrade to the Indigo Tier.

There was an opportunity cost loss with that; but after 4 years, it's now paid itself off, even with CRO hovering at it's current price.

I would give warning though, if you buy CRO to lock up and get the benefits, expect to sustain losses when the bear market hits - but if you plan on being a long term user; then it can certainly be worth it.
