The more concentrate a position (with a tighter range) the higher priority those assets have in being used in trades, that means higher proportion of rewards that come from the trading fees utilized.

Lets say I have 1 ETH and 100k DONUT in a trading range of 400k-450k DONUT.

Someone else has 1 ETH and 100k DONUT in a full range position.

If the current ratio is at 425k DONUT, and someone wants to buy 20k DONUT, my liquidity is a greater percentage of the assets within that range, and so while everyone will earn some fees, I would earn the most fees.

But the trade off for that is, larger price swings can render the position out of range, so now it's not earning any trading fees until the range is restored.
