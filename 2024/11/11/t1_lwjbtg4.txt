This is when unlocks can become dangerous; and what I was hoping would happen with ARB...

Remember algo. It has a LOT of its token unlocks occur during the middle of the bull run. So despite the sell pressure, the token pumped hard. Made it to $3 from memory (or $3 aud, I forget)

It wasn't until the bear market that the huge increase in supply was noticeable as it crashed down to like 15c.

I was hoping ARB would also pump to like $3 or $4, but the token unlocks probably started a bit early to time out like ALGO did
