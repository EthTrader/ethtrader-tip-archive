Via the trading pair. Because DONUT only has a trading pair with ETH, it basically shares a relative peg.

> If Ethereum hits $10k (like 3x gains) donuts make 3x gains as well even tho with 0 volumes in Donuts?

If 1 ETH gives you 500k DONUT, as per the pools available liquidity.

If 1 ETH is pumps to 10k - that 1 ETH will still only purchase 500k DONUT... therefore the value of DONUT must increase, relative to the trading pair it is tied to.
