Thanks you so much for the explanation. It somewhat helped me paint a picture.

>That means, if there is absolutely 0 volume/trades of DONUT, if ETH increases, so too shall DONUT, when ETH drops, DONUT drops too - because it is tied with its trading pair.

I understand this but I couldn't understand the logic behind it. How can the price increase of Ethereum increase the price of donuts, even though there is 0 volume/trades? I mean how their prices are tied with each other?

Doesn't there have to be an actual inflow of money for the price of the donut to go up?

If Ethereum hits $10k (like 3x gains) donuts make 3x gains as well even tho with 0 volumes in Donuts? 

I mean where that money/increase in value comes from? Shouldn't there be actual money inflow into donuts?

I hope I could express myself clear.
