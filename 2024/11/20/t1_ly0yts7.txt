I believe ETH's will play a big part in the future of many services - I consider Ethereum a foundation, or a workshop that a lot of other services can build their products on.  I don't see it ever flipping BTC, but I don't see it losing it's 2nd spot on the ranks either. 

As for market speculation, BTC always runs first, historically, ETH has moved next, then other alts. Perhaps whales have reversed the order, and put money into other alts first this time, before moving to ETH, just to throw a spanner in the works - whales playing whale games xD

In anycase, I believe Ethereum will continue to grow, and it will eventually have it's own leg up and a period where it outperforms the rest of the market again for a timeframe.
