Tbh Elon has shift is focus from being a tech expert to a twitter influencer. I respected him a lot before acquiring Twitter bcos of his vision. Space X, Neuralink, boring company etc.... but now with his meme and influences on crypto, I just lost my respect to him

It seems all his promises was just for money grabs and people who have hope on him will just be disappointed :(
