Do you have any idea how Ethereum can market itself better? I am reading news articles saying Bitcoin is easily marketed as Digital Gold, meanwhile Dogecoin apparently is even more well known than Ethereum and the native asset ETH, because funny dog haha. 

Seems like traditional and new investors have no idea what Ethereum really is and there doesn't seem to be any effort on that end. 

At first I thought the interest in ETH spot ETFs was lacklustre due to the fact that no staking is allowed, but come to think about it there is no yield on Bitcoin ETFs either, the yield goes directly to the miners, and I don't think the 2.7% will result in HUGE inflows anyway, since Fed Funds Rate is way higher than that. 

It's true there's alot of negative sentiment here, but it's backed by the price performance of ETH relative to BTC and SOL as well as the poor performance of the ETH spot ETFs.
