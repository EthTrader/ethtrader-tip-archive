I got lucky timing wise although I did have to ride the 2018 bear, was down to -85% at one point, i kept dcaing and praying XD 

Lowest entry i got was 2020 i forget the exact day but it was dubbed black thursdaybor Tuesday. I got eth at £80

Highest i sold was pure luck, around the £3,100 mark. Was looking to buy house at the time and I cashed a chunk of my holdings out to throw at house deposit as a bonus, just so happened to be at the top of the market.

I do have some poor luck due to inaction, I first considered buying btc in 2013, it was somewhere in the region of £100 to £150 iirc, never bought any though as I was just a poor apprentice on shit wages XD ah well there's always the chance I would have lost it or sold it so no point worrying XD
