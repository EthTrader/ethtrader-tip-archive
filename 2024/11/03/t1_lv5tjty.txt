Lol yup, I've done my suffering XD 

I wish I had got all my eth and more at Â£80 obvs but certainly not gonna complain XD

Yeah it helped me push to a bigger and better house than I would have otherwise been able to afford at the time so I'm incredibly pleased and grateful as to how well things went timing wise. I definitely attribute most of the success down to pure luck though, although definitely some determination on my part with the holding and buying more when down (or stupidity XD)
