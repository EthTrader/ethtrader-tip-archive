The thing is, nobody will truly have that answer for a while. A lot has changed since last bull run.

Proof of Stake and L2's - ETH supply has been both deflationary and inflationary at times.

The development and growth of L2's, also means more money might be in L2 tokens rather than ETH itself, but also fees are less.

ETF's are the thing however, and more big companies have an interest in ETH or Ethereum token's buiilt on the eco-system.

None of these were a thing during the last bull run - so, maybe ETH will be a bit crabby, or maybe it'll have another solid run due to it's growth and development that hasn't seen price action as yet.
