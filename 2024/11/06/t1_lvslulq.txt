All boils down to egos. At least I'm sure that's what happened on this sub

The AT bans likely boil down to egos too. Banning people from your sub just because they are active in others ðŸ™„ Obviously there is some deep rooted history there as well

AT has a lot of good people. Shame really. I'm hardly active on there but from the outside looking in it is just cringe and embarrassing. In fact all of this reddit shit is getting cringe and embarrassing I don't even know why I'm still here xD
