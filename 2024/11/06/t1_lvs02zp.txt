With all due respect the AT team has persistently banned random member of the avatar community simply based on the communities they have been involved in (commented or posted). 

These are not good partners for an inclusive and just community such as yourselves.

Feel free to dm me, they’ve labelled me all sorts yet I am an independent user. I tried reaching out and nothing. I was stalked for weeks by one of the mods jsut due to affiliation with another user that I am not affiliated with. 

Again, I’m happy to chat to any mods in DM. I fear I may get banned for this comment hence offering a conversation out of good will, these are not the guys you should be supporting. 

Sorry to say this, !tip 1
