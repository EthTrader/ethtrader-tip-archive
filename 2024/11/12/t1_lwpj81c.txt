Still a very low rate of inflation

May 5th ETH supply: 120,097,745 ETH 

November 10th ETH supply: 120,423,059 ETH

189 days an increase of 325,314. Convert to yearly increase = 366/189 x 325,314 = 629,973

629,973/120,097,745 = 0.52% annual inflation

Last I checked SOL inflation is more than 10%
