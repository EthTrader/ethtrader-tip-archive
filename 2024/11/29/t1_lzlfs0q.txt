>As expected, none of today’s data releases had any material impact on the markets as traders await next week’s US employment related data, most notably Friday’s unemployment rate which could affect the Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to cut rates again by 0.25% in their December Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the month.
