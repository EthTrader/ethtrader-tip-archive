Some airdrops come completely unexpected, based on criteria around simply using a dapp or network... the best sort of airdrops!

For example, I am 90% confident that I will, at some stage, receive an airdrop of $SYNC, because I have used Syncswap quite a fair bit, although they currently have not announced anything.

Other's, you might have seen official sources, such as their Discord or Twitter/X page announce they will release a token, which you can assume will be airdropped.
