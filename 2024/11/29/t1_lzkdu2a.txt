I'd like to hear other mods thoughts too. Like any proposal an issue has been identified, I have outlined what the issue is and proposed a solution

What I have said in this post is factual. Is it biased because I'm one of the users whose been censored? If so does that mean no one can make a proposal when the issue they are proposing affects them? 

Like you said airlines comment just proves this is needed. Unless we don't want to have free speech, be called a 'DAO' and want censorship.

We are being censored for daring to ask questions. I see lots of bias and strange things happening on the sub but I'm silenced if I mention them
