The Beam Chain won't entail any immediate changes to Ethereum, or even anything radically different from what's already on the chain's roadmap. It does, however, propose a major change to how Ethereum's future upgrades are organized.

Amazing to see how devs are working on innovations that will shape Ethereum's future. This is what makes Ethereum a long term leader.
