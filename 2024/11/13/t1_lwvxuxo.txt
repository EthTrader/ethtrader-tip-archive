Don’t get caught up in the “whale game.” Big players intentionally drop prices, hoping that people with weaker hands will panic-sell, causing the price to drop. Once they achieve their goal of lower prices, these whales buy back in, pushing prices up and triggering FOMO at higher levels. Stick to DCA, stay calm, and let the whales feel stupid when their plan fails.
