Maybe just maybe that's because all people care about is the price. Experts, Analysts, Traders. They all focus merely on the price & we share it & hype every post that offers hopium.

Where are the guides about navigating web3, setting up nodes, operating dapps? Where are the tech debates. I yearn for a crypto forum that explicitly excludes any price related discussion.
