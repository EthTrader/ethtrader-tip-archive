They love everything about gambling. AFAIK illegal gambling is a big issue among young Turkish people at the moment. Considering trading crypto is also kind of like gambling, I can see why they love crypto that much. There is also a big economic crises going on in Turkey, especially younger people have little to no money. They barely survive. Crypto is an option for them to make money.

Additional info: Everything is 2x expensive there compared to EU countries and the US since their government suppress the foreign currencies like USD and Euro which results in very valuable turkish lira which is fake. So the situation is rough for it's people.
