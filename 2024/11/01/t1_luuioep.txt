The main reason real estate is not that much because the prices have been skyrocketed and mortgage interest rates are too high and you need a very good income and very good credit score to be able to get a mortgage. Even if you get mortgage it only covers for %20-30 of the total value of the real estate. So if you don't have $200-300k in cash it's impossible to get a nice flat.

People also aware that the real estate prices are inflated so it's quite dumb to invest in real estate with cash in Turkey at the moment.
