That's wrong. I follow real estate closely all around the world and real estates in Turkey have skyrocketed in USD let alone in turkish lira. For example a house that was worth $1m a few years ago now worths at least $2m. That's mostly because their government suppressing foreign currencies like USD which results in a fake valuable turkish lira. BTW I think turkish people don't have enough money to buy a house so they go with crypto.
