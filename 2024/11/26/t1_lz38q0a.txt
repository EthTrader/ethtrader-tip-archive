Too many Link posts does need to be addressed.

However, one problem i see is that incentives for Links will bring it at same level with Comedy/Memes/Media. We may just end up with loads of comedy posts.

Either this needs to be changed to 0.5x or Comedy/Media Flair needs to be nerfed to 0.1x again.
