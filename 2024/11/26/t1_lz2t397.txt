Again, I'd much rather make it an requirement that the poster must write a minimum of words about the post alongside with the link. Many posters don't read the articles they share & therefore don't even recognize when they are of poor quality or contain wrong information. Just copy link, paste link, press "post" needs to stop entirely! Posters often add a short one-liner as first comment to farm double. And links drive litterally take people elsewhere when we want to grow the sub.

So... that's my thoughts on link posts. Incentive reduction helps but it isn't the best solution. \[YES\]
