>We could theoretically vote some of the mods out...

That would be a shame. Personally i would never vote for any mod to be terminated. The mod team would be the best to take that decision.

>but... people would need to buy back their DONUTs first  
And then complain mods have too much governance power /s

Thats the biggest issue. But recently I've seen that users have started to hold on to their Donuts. Maybe it will hit $1 someday ðŸ‘€
