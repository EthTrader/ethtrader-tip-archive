[YES]

A moderator censoring comments or replying harshly by taking concerns personally is a big red flag, atleast for me.  
It has now gone too far, with a mod even giving users timeouts on Discord simply for raising concerns. This is another red flag and a clear example of abuse of power.

If this is how things are going to continue them we should seriously consider stopping the use of the word **DAO**

r/Ethtrader DAO can only be successful by the collective efforts of users and mods. There should be proper communication and everyone must be open to constructive criticism if it helps improve the community.

I support the idea of a separate sub. I'm confident no reasonable person would disagree with this.
