I prefer the idea of an r/EthTraderMeta sub rather than a monthly post.

That helps reduce governance based discussion, and possibly arguements, from counting towards the 50 comment cap, but also provides an easier archive to search for previous discussions. It also means those posts/comments arn't eligible for DAO rewards either, nor subject to pay2post fees.

I guess, being a long term r/cc member, I'm also just quite accustomed to having a separate meta thread to help keep the main sub "on topic".
