\[YES\] Only if I am allowed to get inspiration from Twitter content /s

I got a warning back in the days for that and I dont want to be banned for an ambiguous rule that was applied in the past but not now. I mean, if I see for example a TA tweet, I elaborate my own TA image and write my own text. That could be considered idea/content theft right? Same as watching a portfolio image on Twitter and then making my own portfolio image and sharing the same conceptual title than the Twitter.

I really want to clarify this because I have seen that in the sub, in the past I was called out and I have no clue if I can do it too.

Also I think it is important to clarify if this governance poll, if passes, if it will be retroactive and instantly applied in the coming snapshot (current cycle) or if it will start in the next period (next cycle).
