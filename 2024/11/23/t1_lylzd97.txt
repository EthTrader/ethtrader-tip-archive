>farmers do help maintain some activity on the sub, but not all activity is productive. that's been proven countless times before. most farmers focus on farming DONUT by posting repetitive or low-effort content, which doesn’t contribute to ecosystem scalability or subreddit development.

I somewhat agree with that. But who decides what is low effort and what is not? If a "wen shib $1" can bring decent activity to the sub, then its a win.

>but imo it’s ironic to see criticism from those who never submit useful proposals or help with development work. (not saying this is the case)

Criticism is necessary as it offers fresh perspectives to the aspects we might have missed or never thought about. It shouldn't be taken personally as we all want same thing for the sub.

>we should at least respect those who are driving scalability forward and take a lot of time away from their lives to invest in the project.

We do appreciate that, atleast i do. But, if anyone opts for a role to work for the DAO and is getting monthy incentive then there is no point discussing it.

>but let's leave this discussion for another thread to avoid unnecessary drama and stay focused on the main topic here

Fair enough. Peace. 🕊️
