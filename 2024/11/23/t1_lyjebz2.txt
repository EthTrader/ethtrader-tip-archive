We have watched an overzealous SEC venture closer and closer to directly regulating individual developers and users in their exchange redefinition rulemaking, and their enforcement actions against wallet providers like Consensysâ€™ Metamask and Coinbase Wallet. We have also seen surveillance issues come to the fore: 6050I reporting obligations, Tornado Cash sanctions, broker reporting obligations, and unlicensed money transmission prosecutions for non-custodial developers.

Incase anyone asking why Crypto people supported Trump.
