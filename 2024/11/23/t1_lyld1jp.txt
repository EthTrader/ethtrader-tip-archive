\[YES\] Will the following things come with a $$$ cost?

*  Updating protocols, exchanges, and partners to replace the current symbol requires some work. However, that would be a task for the Ecosystem Growth Lead ([](https://www.reddit.com/user/0xMarcAurel/)).
* Updates to the Special Membership NFT, user flairs, and other designs with the old symbol would also be needed. Yet again, these changes would also be managed by the Ecosystem Growth Lead.
* New logo

I mean, will it be any kind of $$$ reward for the work done in all the above steps or it is already financed?
