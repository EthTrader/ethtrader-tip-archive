I like the old design but wouldn't mind a refreshing look. But I'd still like to know about the cost implications for doing this, same as i asked for the DAO logo which is still unanswered.

Any proposal should also highlight the estimated cost involved (if any) which makes it easier for the community to vote on. Or if its going to be a separate Donut initiative, then that needs to be highlighted as well.
