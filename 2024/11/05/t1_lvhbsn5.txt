Good information. I'd like to add a bit of context.

* In the early 2000s USD was well over 70%
* This does not account for other types of reserves such as gold. A wholistic perspective reduces the significance of the dollar.
* Sentiment & trend are also important. Many countries want away from the USD. They see the American debt spiral.
