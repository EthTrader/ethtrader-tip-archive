>the gas fee on Polygon Network is measured in POL which is $0.5808

Paying 58 cents for gas on polygon is actually craxy tbh..... I did USDT Tron transactions recently too and the Tron gas fees compared to transferring any other TRX token is very high.

Stablecoins transaction on TRX is higher and then I learn how to buy energy which reduces my cost on Tron. 

Thanks for the guide btw, it's helpful
