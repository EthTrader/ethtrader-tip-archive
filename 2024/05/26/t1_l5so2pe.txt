I'm stuck at a literal fiat mine, work camp, and didn't want to bring seed phrases with me into a communal living space.. Reddit deleted my vault randomly so all I have are backups now.. I even had to give up my RP validator to a best friend to look after :S but didn't give them keys to the castle for me to do anything useful remotely. I'm basically naked here without any of my stuff, which I know isn't ideal and it'll be my fault if I lose any crypto or miss the bull, but I didn't really have an alternative.

Does tipping just take from your future issuance, or somehow current holdings? I don't remember what I signed or did to set Donuts up, it's been so long. I'd rather give away my ~10k Donuts than let a single one burn, or I guess maybe tip myself in a new wallet I have custody of lol.
