Thanks for making this post. It's absolutely critical to have community involvement here. !tip 100

I support keeping the constitution *concise* and *substantive*. To that end I would suggest removing Section 2 which i think is unnecessary/redundant. Also agree with other mentions regarding the italic bit on DONUT.

Rather than jump in straight to DONUT, we can illustrate first what it is that DONUT/CONTRIB might address and that, imo, is: *recognition and reward for contribution*. Whether it's administrative help, growth, content, whatever.
