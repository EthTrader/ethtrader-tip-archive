Vitalik Buterin's vision for Ethereum was always to create a platform for decentralized applications, not just a speculative asset. While Ethereum has matured and gained popularity through various means, including ETH ETFs and memecoins, these elements often focus on short-term gains rather than long-term utility. Memecoins, in particular, might drive on-chain activity and burn ETH, but they don't necessarily contribute to the meaningful growth of the ecosystem. Vitalikâ€™s dedication to Ethereum's true potential highlights the importance of questioning the true utility and advancement the ecosystem offers. The real value lies in practical applications and innovation within the blockchain space, aligning with Vitalik's original vision.
