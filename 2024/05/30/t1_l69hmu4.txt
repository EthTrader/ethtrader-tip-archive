I don’t trade Eth **directly**, never did and never will. My plan is a bit different.

Even though I trade for a living, I only fully cash out my profits if I need them. Because I spot swing trade most of the time, I usually convert a big portion of the gains into Eth. That’s how I accumulate, and how I’ve always been doing it.

Recently, though, I haven’t been doing it because I’m the average discount enjoyer, so I’m  converting my profits into stablecoins and having them ready to cash in on a gem of a trade I spot. Alternatively, if Eth dips, I’ll buy it. No matter how small the dip is.
