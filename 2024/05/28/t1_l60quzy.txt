The key is learning how to buy and when to sell and setting realistic goals to increase in each decision you make the probabilities of success.

For example, this cycle my goal is to get as much as possible to buy a flat. Next cycles I will apply all the learned stuff to keep increasing my money until I can retire. I will probably have a gamble/trading budget, etc.

The day I jumped into crypto I knew that I would be here forever.
