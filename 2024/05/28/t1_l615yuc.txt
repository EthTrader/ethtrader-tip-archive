Realistically, even after being involved in crypto since 2017-2018, I am not dependent on it nor do I believe it will change my life financially. I have made a pretty good living from my job and family business. Crypto is more like a hobby to me now. 

But I wish all the luck to those who seek financial freedom through crypto. Just one 2000x can change lives! You never know.
