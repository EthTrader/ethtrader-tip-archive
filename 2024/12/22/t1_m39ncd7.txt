There are two types of investments long-term and short-term. And you must be clear about that while investing.

For long-term projects: You have to believe in the tech of the project and the rest regardless of the price fluctuations.

For short-term projects: Here, your emotions come into play because you are only looking for quick money and have no belief in tech or such things.

So it is very important to clear about your strategy. If you messed up with long-term projects with short-term project strategy, you'll always lose.
