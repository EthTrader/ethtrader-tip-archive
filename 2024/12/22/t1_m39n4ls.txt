I will never get tired of repeating these:

* Sell in May and go away.
* Fortune favors the patient.
* Always keep an eye to BTC.d and macroeconomics.
* Have a real exit plan and get it ready.
* Even if you sell "low", nobody becomes poor from taking profit.

I am probably missing a lot of things but in summary. DYOR and never let your feelings get involved in your investments.
