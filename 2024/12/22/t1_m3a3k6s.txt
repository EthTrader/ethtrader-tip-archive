Influencers in crypto known Bitcoin so well and promotes it because Bitcoin is the face of cryptocurrency. But that still doesn't mean they don't own eth and other alts as well. Eth doesn't really needs the promotion Bitcoin have. If you want to get into DEFI, NFTS or some airdrops, you'll definitely needs Eth to transacts.

Though it'll be nice to have influencers shilling Eth but ETH really can survive without influencers.
