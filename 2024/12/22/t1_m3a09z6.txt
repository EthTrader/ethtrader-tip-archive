> I'm considering to trade the DONUTs exceeding my CONTRIB (8.5k) because only contrib use cases are relevant to me

Depends if you want to trade the DONUT out for another asset now; or if you want to hold onto it for to maintain a maximum governance score potential down the track.

Due to some mechanics, you can actually earn more CONTRIB then DONUT - for example, voting on governance polls, rewards additional CONTRIB only, and there have been other CONTRIB only based rewards/incentives for activities in the past.

Theres no right or wrong approach, everyone can choose to hold whatever DONUT/CONTRIB ratio they desire
