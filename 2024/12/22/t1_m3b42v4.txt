There was a huge fiasco a year ago or so where the founder a big share of his stake as collateral for a loan to buy mansions. The funds were locked and he couldnt sell to cover the loans so he did some OTC deals. It couldve ended terribly because it would affect other Defi protocols as well. So theres a lot of centralization on Curve and those whale addresses are probably team members !tip 1
