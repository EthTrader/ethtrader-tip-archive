I think to understand the market cycle psychology, it's important to know how your psyche works and needs to control it.

Like you never really know how high prices will go wen the market trend is rising, the same in the case of decline.

Wen market is going high - naturally greed comes in mind (for more potential gains and we don't sell wen it is supposed to be)

Wen market is declined to certain levels - (to escape from loss we sell in panic)

The best way to overcome this psychology is to stick with your plan. The opportunities are always around. We just need to avail it sensibly in our favour and get the emotions out of the investments.
