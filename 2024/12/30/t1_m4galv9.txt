In my experience, airdrop hunting has been quite successful.

I know a lot of people are unimpressed when criteria and allocations are announced; but my approach was to never go too hard or overboard with farming.

When hunting Starknet, ZKSync, Blast, Layer3, Scroll and Linea, i really used the Arbitrum eligibility list for inspiration - and essentially did minimal farming, just going for consistency over an extended period of time.

Probably spent less than $150 worth of ETH in gas and minting fees, but got rewarded in close to 8k worth of airdrop - Linea, Berachain and Syncswap to come.
