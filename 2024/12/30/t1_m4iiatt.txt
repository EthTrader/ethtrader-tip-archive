One step closer to apply my guides trading knowledge!

Nice guide! Just a friendly suggestion, add bold text to the titles or use title hashtag to make them big. Markdown guide here [https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/wiki/markdown/](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/wiki/markdown/)

If you are in browser and dont use markdown you can find those tools in the text bar.
