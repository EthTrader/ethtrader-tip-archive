>with a significant portion of my posts in CC being removed for violating some rule or another

RCC has a topic limit websites. I've contacted them in the past about checking the topic limiter before posting but still the post get removed. 

It was explained that it was because when a post got removed, that a person post can be caught up by the topic limiter as well if it's part of the top50 post. So the topic limiter bot just removed post that is limited even if the post is hours it was posted. 

>I suspect there's a better solution out there than what we've come up with thus far

Well cool. I hope the community can come up with an idea that'll be worth it
