Master experience as user here always finding grey areas and mod in r/KirtVerse. Open to mod other communities. /s


I think the solution relies on automatized AI tools that analyzes content + articles or whatever based on a previously trained AI for this specific task. + Adding other kind of metrics as user history + social trends and with all of this the AI can easily determine a rank that is then compared with a threshold and if doesnt pass it, it is sent to mod queue.


However that requires a ton of work that probably can be done without Reddit properly getting involved in the task.


Just brainstorming here with a dumb joke on the top xD
