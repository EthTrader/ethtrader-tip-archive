It's just FUD coming. MiCA goal at first is to protect EUR. This is why they are forcing exchanges to only allow EUR based stablecoins and probably forcing those EUR based stablecoins issuers to hold the same EUR amount in their treasuries. This just removes power from USD in the end and protects EUR.

The rest of things, yes, they are going to try to control it all but regarding the latest FUD, it is just FUD and USDT wont collapse xD
