From my point of view we are really early. I am a dev and 99.99% of them still have no clue about crypto stuff. And regarding the bank I work for, well. Big joke xD

We are still in early stages of this tech. Crypto reminds me right now to my first smartphone. I tried using it a few months ago and damn... Things have evolved xD
