DCA and enjoy the ride but what if I tell you that you could make a fun Dynamic DCA where  you use this tools to try to "time" the market in each DCA time span?

For example, you DCA every week so you have 7 days to time the market and DCA in that time. I used to do that during the winter (very boring times) and this way increase the profit you will make with really low risk?
