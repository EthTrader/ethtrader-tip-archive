The Proposal to "[Make Images & Video posts an exclusive perk](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1h0h43z/governance_poll_proposal_make_images_video_posts/)" hasn't received sign-offs from 2 mods. It cannot be queued for the current governance week as per rule. 

Needs to be signed and to be queued for the next governance week.
