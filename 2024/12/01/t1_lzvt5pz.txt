Nice write up. 
i would have never bought meme coins 6 month ago and i won't do it now when we have a new ath. 
I just handle the fomo and think about that in a bull run such opportunities are presented nearly every day, which i will all also miss of course :D
I go for a saver approach and stick with the big two mostly.
