I haven't seen the $10k analysis in here recently about ETH. They're tired.

But tbh, this year was bad? Yes but I think if we have to look at the yearly chart of ETH 2024, the chart will be up like 48% if I'm not wrong and if you held through those months, you'll be up 36% with the current price of the yearly chart
