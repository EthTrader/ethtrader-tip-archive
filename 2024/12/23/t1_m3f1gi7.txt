>My other advice is to buy a cheap laptop for just crypto. Create your own ATM xD (Around a $200 worth laptop is enough). That laptop will only be used to connect to bookmarked exchanges and sites and 99% the times wont be used to anything else.

This is a really good tip. I also have one old laptop that I don't use other than big exchanges.

It's really so easy to lost your crypto savings even if you think you are a tech navvy.
