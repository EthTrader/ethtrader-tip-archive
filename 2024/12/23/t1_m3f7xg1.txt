I mean that was a bit of expected since all those politicians and billionaires talked like the only crypto exist is bitcoin. Bitcoin was mainstream, everywhere. I know Trump holds a small amount of Ethereum, his promises have been about Bitcoin. He even attended to bitcoin conference lol.

I still think majority of the crypto investors don't even realized how useful Etheruem is. They don't see it's potential fully yet.
