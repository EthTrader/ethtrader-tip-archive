But it's worked quite well in cryptocurrency subreddit. I remember that top holders and top active earners were all avoiding selling their moons to get bonus each distributions (I'm talking about 2020-2021). And it's price was performing good back then. 

Of course it would be better to give benefits for having high governance score than just punishing sellers but for now having too much governance score doesn't have that much advantage. You can't eve create that much of a difference in governance polls because there are mods that have millions of governance power.

I still think sellers penalty is a good idea.
