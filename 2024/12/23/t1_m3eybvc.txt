As some of you may already know, I lost quite a decent chunk of health and money in a hack few months ago.

My cold wallet Trezor basically saved my life. All my browser hot wallets got compromised and I believe due to the fact that bitwarden was unlocked that he managed to access them but still so risky.

My REAL advice is to NEVER use crypto in your personal devices (only a third layer wallet that holds what $100 top just to play around).

My other advice is to buy a cheap laptop for just crypto. Create your own ATM xD (Around a $200 worth laptop is enough). That laptop will only be used to connect to bookmarked exchanges and sites and 99% the times wont be used to anything else.

Stay safe and if one day you make a really dumb mistake dont blame yourself and if you need to talk to someone, DM me. I have been there in the dark.

Nice post OP.
