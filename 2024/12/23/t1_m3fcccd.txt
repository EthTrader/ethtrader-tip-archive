>But tbh, this year was bad? Yes. But I think if we have to look at the yearly chart of ETH 2024, the chart will be up like 48% if I'm not wrong and if you held through those months, you'll be up 36% with the current price of the yearly chart

Compared to how other projects in the top 10 performed, this year was bad for ETH.
