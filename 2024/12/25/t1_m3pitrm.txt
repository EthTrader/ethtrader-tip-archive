I believe every investor needs at least 1 cycle to really adapt to how the market moves. Also learning how to TA during that time is very important.

In my case, next cycle once I have my flat with mortgage the investing strategy changes. I will be able to afford more risks so I will probably have a bag to play trading.

I expect it going bad xD
