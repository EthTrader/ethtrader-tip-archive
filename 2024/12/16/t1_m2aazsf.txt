The thing is traditional market participants have already firmly ingrained in their brains that BTC is digital gold, and it seems impossible to change that narrative right now.

ETH probably will get a different narrative like "World Computer", "Blockchain Appstore", "Digital Oil" or maybe even "Digital Bonds/Treasuries" because they have an income stream. Based on headlines from the likes of Bloomberg and Reuters, ETH doesn't have a tagline or elevator pitch to non-savvy investors right now.
