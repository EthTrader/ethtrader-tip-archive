>I think initially BTC will get all the love, and BTC dominance will increase - but i think that was going to happen around this time anyway.

Yeah, it was/is sort of inevitable. 

>I'm confident ETH will catch back up a little bit down the track and the previous patterns of "the cycle" will continue, but I'm certainly confident and hopeful that Ethereum really is the backbone and foundation of giving Cryptocurrency a use case that could see adoption within the corporate sector.

That's right. Even if politicians/government ignore ETH, Institutions wouldn't. 

>If that's the case, we will be happy to be early, and those staking can certainly continue to reap the rewards of passive gains too.

We all hope this is the case. It will be one of our biggest wins.
