Next distro is probably coming in the next few days, but by the look of things, you haven't been overly active in this sub - so, i doubt you will receive anything - but the mods will release CSV data in the next day or so.

When you do receive DONUT, they will be distributed automatically at the end of the round, so theres no need to claim anything.

So this tip I send you now; you'll end up receiving when the next round ends in mid January
