If ETH dips 40 - 50%, then it'll be a huge opportunity for those who didn't enter the race. 
People make and lose good money wen prices dip and pump hard. 

So stick with your goals. You always have an opportunity to make money.

*Despite the ETH underperformance, I still believe 2025 is the year of ETH.*
