I think being a member cost a few thousands donuts (Maybe 5k? I'm not sure what is the exact amount currently). Everyone tips each other to send donuts each other (a way of showing appreciation). Btw the more tips you receive the more donuts you'll receive at the distributions as well. I'm assuming you know what donut and distribtuion is since you are registered.
