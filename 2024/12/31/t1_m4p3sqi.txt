It's funny how bad regulators do their job.

In my case I converted my USD related stablecoins to EUR based ones as soon as I heard the news. I understand the reason why MiCA is requiring it but damn, be clear with what will happen too xD

They can always send me their USDT and I will convert it for them 👀
