Totally, its funny how everything even looks orchestrated but I believe it is just some big boys releasing X type of content and then the rest acting like sheep.

For example, there are times that this sub BTC or SOL maxi activity increases and somehow users to laugh at ETH or FUD about it pops up from nowhere.

From my point of view which I am 35% ETH and 35% BTC is quite dumb to "brigade" other places or act like that. You wont get anyone changing their minds and its kind of childish. I believe all here are in the same boat right now but I also believe that some people fears about ETH flippening BTC or whatever. I dont believe in that. I believe both are really different things that will have their own role in the coming future.
