[YES] Because I do believe that creating memes, especially original ones takes more effort rather than just posting an image. Also people who pay for special membership should get some benefits, and this could be a good incentive.

However I remember at one point crypto subs had a problem of getting overrun with memes as they often attract users from outside the sub which will push them to hot. The 0.50x multiplier is also pretty lucrative (5 tips to breakeven which is very achievable), so that could encourage people to post 3 memes per day. Another user suggested below on topic limits for memes, which sounds like a simple and effective solution.
