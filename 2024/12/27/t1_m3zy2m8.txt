>I know you guys all probably don't like me

Bro, we don't even know you. By the way, MEXC is an exchange that requires no KYC. You can get ETH from MEXC and do whatever you wants to do with it. 

But mind you, if anyone is telling you to get them ETH for a passive income, they're probably trying to scam you. So be safe out there. You're still young and scammers are getting too much in the crypto space buddy
