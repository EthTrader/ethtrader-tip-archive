I mean we currently have MEDIA flair and COMEDY flair.

Media flair can based on a screenshot from Twitter etc

Comedy doesn't have to be image, we can make a text post that's funny and tag it like comedy. The way it's done in RCC. 

While meme flair should be only base on just memes(an image with a text?)
