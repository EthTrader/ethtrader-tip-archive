I think it would be a positive change; we really don't need to see 150 links being posted a day, there simply isn't that much worth reading about. Nothing wrong with only having a handful of actual hot topics to discuss.

By comparison, despite only having about 200 users on the CSV, we have 4-5x the posts being submitted per day, compared to r/cryptocurrency which has several thousands of users on the CSV.

Yes, we have plenty of unregistered users also engaging in the sub, but they only come to the hot topics, a handful of the 100+ posts being published each day.
