Reducing the multiplier of link posts is a great idea but 0.25 would be too harsh. I think 0.5 would be better. 

Or instead of reducing the multiplier of link posts, we can increase the multiplier of text posts from 1 to 1.25 or 1.5. This would encourage users to post more text posts and less link posts.
