The things that stood out to me are:

* Hyperchains: Infinite scaling through parallel, customizable chains.
* Account Abstraction: Pay gas fees with any token for smoother transactions.
* zkPorter: Ultra-low fees with off-chain data availability for faster, cheaper transactions.

What do you guys look forward to?
