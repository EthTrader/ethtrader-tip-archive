I never really cared about them anyways. I already rotated some of my LINK profits to ETH because its the lowest right now between BTC LINK and ETH - Normally I rotate between the three to the lowest between them. I stopped the DCA on LINK but still have a small bag that I will hold until probably 50 dollars !tip 1
