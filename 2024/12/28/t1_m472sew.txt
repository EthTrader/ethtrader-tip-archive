Yes, however always check it in zerogpt. The other day I wrote one and passed it and it said 20% and I was like how is this even possible if I wrote this sentence myself and it has even the classic kirtash93 English mistakes xD

I had to rewrite it like 3 times because zerogpt wanted to trigger it for no reason.
