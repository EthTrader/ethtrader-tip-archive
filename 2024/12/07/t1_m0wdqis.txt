The MooDeng on Ethereum didn't do well but the the original one on Solana is still doing pretty solid at $0.52. The total supply on Ethereum is too fcuking high.

This was amongst the few memecoins on which i made a decent profit in fees on Meteora pools. Unfortunately i ended up selling my bags just before that massive pump. Bad luck i guess.
