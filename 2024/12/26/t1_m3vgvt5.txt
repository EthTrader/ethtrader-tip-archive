First, I believe that Each bettor's decision is shaped by very long chain of their prior knowledge (their understanding of the game market, their emotional state, market trends). 


The decision to bet and the outcome is governed by deterministic causes. The outcome of the bet is determined by prior causes, even if it feels random.


Even if randomness plays a role in the outcome, I strongly believe that randomness itself is part of deterministic process. 


The act of me commenting your post is inevitable outcome. My personal history, my knowledge, the visibility of the post, the time of day, platform algorithm, all of these factors made it happen. 


The very long chain of causes leads to the inevitable outcome of my commenting.
