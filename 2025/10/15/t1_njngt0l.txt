Personally I think that PoW is okay for certain things and PoS is better for others. PoS is the best option for how I understand Ethereum ecosystem and goal. 

For a store of value and maybe govs currency and for some countries currency PoW is fine but not for a system that needs to manage insane amount of transactions and whole on top ecosystems.

Both are valid but for different purposes.
