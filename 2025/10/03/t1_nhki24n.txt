Spot on!

That cost me too xD. All three of my posts were deleted as well. 

I actually read Marcâ€™s post in time and went to renew my membership, but there was no countdown showing, like x days y minutes left to finish the season. I thought may be it was just some kind of delay, so I didnâ€™t bother connecting my wallet ðŸ˜”. Just realized wen posts were deleted.

*In the end, I know it was just my laziness.*
