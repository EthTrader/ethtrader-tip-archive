here is the latest update; once Season 7 ended (5 days ago)

A new 30 day rolling membership model has been implemented, to take a lot of the manual work out of the devs hands

But it seems there was an issue with the flair recognizing this, hence users without a current active membership still had the flair showing.

DevMatt was able to identify the issue and user flairs should now update accurately to reflect membership status again.
