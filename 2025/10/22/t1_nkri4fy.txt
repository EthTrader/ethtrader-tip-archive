Yeah. So many new rules I’m getting rekt by. 

Putting donut in LP pool is a no go unless you have e above 20k. 

Writing text post is a nogo unless you formulate it very childishly or like Meme ish. 

Because if you write it well and neatly looking and spend a lot of time writing it… it will be nuked to oblivion as someone will claim it’s AI written. 

Links often get deleted. 

Idk why ethtrader even exist anymore.  Only people here seems to be BTC maxis trolling 

I’ve been a ETH and donut lover for 6 years.

But I feel like its impossible to be a part of this sub… ppl don’t want links. People don’t want memes. People don’t want hand written well formulated and formatted posts. 

Idk what people want here besides bullying Ethereum fans. 

Only way to contribute is in the daily which is 95% dead compared to a few years ago. 

I will take some time to consider if this sub and token is worth my time. 

I’m not into writing jibberish. But getting well formulated posts deleted because of it being 24% compatible with something a AI can write… pfft. 

This sub is not what it was. It went from good to useless jibberish farming to over extremely cirkle jerk farming. 

But rules are rules sadly. Maybe 1 day my beloved donut will shine again.
