Sub is active. But most replying is just trolling people or ethereum haters. And rules about posts are very harsh imo. But it is what it is. I might just leave Reddit again. After superstonk leading me to this sub it might just be time to quit Reddit and do my own thing. Ethereum will keep climbing. But Iâ€™m not gonna keep wasting my time on Reddit. Idk. 

Time will tell. !tip 1
