Yes, I wouldn’t be surprised if Polygon got a big surprise before EOY!

I don’t know why Polygon is still so underrated and undervalued. Their team is actually doing a great job! They even distributed POL in r/CC based on contributions - it would be awesome to see the same thing happen in this sub too.
