Yesterday, I added a few more DONUTs to the LP and claimed my rewards for the first time - it felt amazing to earn those extra DONUTs!

I have a question - Is it a good idea to create a separate MetaMask wallet just for providing liquidity, so I don’t have to connect my main DONUT wallet all the time❓️

I don’t know why, but I always feel a bit nervous when connecting my wallet xD. Still, the rewards are totally worth it!

*Thanks for introducing an additional method to earn DONUTs*
