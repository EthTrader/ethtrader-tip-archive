I would keep using the original wallet because

1. This way the dounts you put in the pool are counted towards your earn ratio, if you transfer to another wallet they count as sold. 

2. If you ever sell dounts you need to connect to sushi as well, which I assume you did already at some point, so not point in doing something different week interacting with the pool.
