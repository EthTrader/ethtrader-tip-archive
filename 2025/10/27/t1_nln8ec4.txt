Its crabbing because of macro economics and uncertainty. After the bottom of the real winter I started to notice some sort of delays but didnt pay much attention but that feeling got stronger with time.

Market cycles just follow money and macros, Fed hasnt stopped the QT yet so that means that theres still room to grow when they stop and start buying.

I am young, achieved my flat goal and now I can hold all my tokens forever.
