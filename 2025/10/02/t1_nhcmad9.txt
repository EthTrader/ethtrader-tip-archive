*What I do not like is considering staking as taxable income.*

I don't have an issue with stake rewards being taxed, it's no different to stock dividends or bank interest IMO; however (And this is obviously subject to country and relevant tax policies). 

Of course, income tax and capital gains tax can have different rates for different governments as well.

The way is currently works in my area is we are taxed on the stake rewards we earn, at the price of the time we receive it, as income tax. And then taxed again on the conversion to fiat, as capital gains (or capital loss).

Either way. It should be simplified xD
