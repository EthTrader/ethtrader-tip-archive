It's definitely a more complex side of DeFi, I remember following guides and learning the ropes elsewhere a few years back and felt like I was way in over my head!

I like being able to help others explore DeFi and actually use cryptocurrency, not only are there plenty of opportunities to create more wealth for oneself, and all these on-chain metrics (holders, liquidity pool size and spread, transactions, trading volume) help crypto grow.
