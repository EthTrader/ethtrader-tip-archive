$6k is achievable.. maybe not this cycle but the next one. For that to happen ETH needs new inflows and not 'recycled' hype. There was a big liquidity shift this year, it was not a very stable year with Trump x China etc. Recovery will happen with institutions buying in mass and retail will eventually FOMO in.
