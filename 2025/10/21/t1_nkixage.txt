*When the Bitcoin maxis claim that BTC is scarce and ETH is not.*

  
Well, they can legitimately claim that BTC is limited and ETH is unlimited.

But of course, the inflationary/deflationary nature is entirely dependant on the burn mechanisms for ETH, and how many transactions the network facilitates. 

It'll be fascinating to see what the circulating supply numbers look like in 2, 5, 10 years time!
