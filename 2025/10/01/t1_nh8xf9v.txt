Hnn... Actually, I'm learning how to do

Let me tell you the steps that I did after connecting my wallet.

Press Add liquidity 

Then click create position 

Then click full range

Then, Select DONUT and put 200 Donut and Approved transaction 

May be now you have a better idea what I did and where I get wrong. 

But I need to figure out what I need to do and what I've actually done.

*No issues, that's why I played with a small amount of DONUT*

Thanks for the big tip ðŸ˜Š!
