Could you also do the same stats for the main net liquidity pool?  Would be nice to compare and also give a better overview over liquidity for dounts in general and volume. 

I would also like to see a list of liquidity providers, since rewards are higher on main net. Is the pool on main net also owned by the top few percentage?

Das to see trading volume fall that much, even though ratio kept steady.
