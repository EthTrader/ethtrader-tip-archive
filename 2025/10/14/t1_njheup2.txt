For people wondering about comments with "!tip", the `!tip` command allows users to tip DONUT, this subreddit's native token.

**!tip** is the command and **[number]** is the amount of DONUT being tipped. So:

`!tip 1` means someone is tipping you 1 DONUT.

r/EthTrader has a unique rewards system, where community participation earns you DONUT. Donuts are exclusive, tradable internet points.
