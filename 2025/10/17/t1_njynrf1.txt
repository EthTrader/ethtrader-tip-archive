I am with you, they stack at lower prices to maximize their returns on future growth from things like adoption and upgrades. So yeah if prices go up while they are building it will be bad for entering, higher average cost, more costs for infrastructure and projects and more gas needed. I think retail lost control before institutions.. we already had whales and CEX's. If anything institutions add more liquidity and also legitimacy, but unfortunately the price to pay for that is centralized influence.
