IMO, the ideal situation is where the price slowly increases over time, adoption takes place, and those who are helping support the Ethereum eco-system and DeFi stand to make gains, through Staking, Liquidity Provision etc.

And of course, stablecoin usage from companies help maintain volume and transaction activity to help burn ETH, while there is a constant rate of freshly issued ETH from staking.
