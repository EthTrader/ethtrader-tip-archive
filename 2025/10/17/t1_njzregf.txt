If you are a big institution: Why buy ETH at 10-15k when you can push price down and keep buying in the 2-4k range?

Look at the supply metrics. At this current rate the “circulating supply” will last a few years. Then it won’t really be possible to keep ETH undervalued. 

The demand for ETH is much bigger than the inflation. And I don’t see that changing anytime soon. !tip 1
