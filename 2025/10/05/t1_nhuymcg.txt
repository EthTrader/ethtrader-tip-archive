So much good news for us crypto club folks. US Govt should shutdown more often. Cheers folks, now remember there will be a correction at some point, dont get your panties all in a wad...its just normal correction, all assets/investments tend to do. As long as overall trajectory is pointing up, its all good. Cheers again!
