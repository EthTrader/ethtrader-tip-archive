This is my humble opinion: the only way to dethrone Ethereum would be if a chain were equally or more decentralized, had more privacy and was cheap and fast. In my opinion Monero meets some of these requirements but is still far behind Ethereum which makes sense since Monero's sole focus is privacy!!
