> Is it a good time to add DONUT/ETH in liquidity pool❓️

Honestly, it's no better or worse time than before the flash crash.

ETH has tanked in price, DONUT has tanked in price... and the DONUT/ETH ratio is the same, which means DONUT has dumped due to it's trading pair with ETH.

To put numbers to it.

2 days ago, 1 ETH got you 1.3M DONUT

Right now, 1 ETH gets you 1.3M DONUT
