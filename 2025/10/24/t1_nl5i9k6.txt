>A little of topic but how is your liquidity pool position working out for you?

I think it's fine. Honestly, I'm not worried much because I had already made my mind to put 5k DONUT after each round, whether it's in favour or not. I hope if something dramatic happens, you guys can alert in the daily.

*The good thing is that I got a better understanding of impermanent loss and how it functions.*

>Already collected some rewards?

Not yet! 

Question: Do we get rewards in DONUT❓️

Thanks for checking with me.
