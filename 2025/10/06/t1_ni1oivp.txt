My brain is moving from selling my crypto ATH to just hold BTC and ETH and only sell alts.

My other idea is to retrieve my initial investment on BTC and ETH so this way I have money to jump in next winter but still dont lose a position on both assets. Regarding other alts, always sell xD

I have so many doubts right now because real world status and where I believe we are going makes me think that I should do this.
