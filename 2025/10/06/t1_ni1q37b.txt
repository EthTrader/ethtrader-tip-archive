I sometimes struggle to find something, I feel worthy of posting. Sometimes I read or think of something but find someone beat me to it or it so similar...I mean how many times/theory's do we need on what next quarter going to be like. I want to be original a bit.

Also, This weekend I thought about posting about a newsletter I get called ETH Weekly and ask where do others get info from. But as someone stated already, as with Reddit in general...mention other forms of media get deleted or banned. (I say w all sincerity, this community does not seem that bad about that) The other day a post of mine got deleted by mods on r/cryptocurrency because I mentioned my mother. Got "we dont need to hear about your momma" Well...sorry but my mother is a fiancial advisor and as an investor done amazingly well.

Ive mentioned my mom on here and thats not happened, but I always find myself reading rules...I found a really intresting piece on wallet tokens and how much most wallets make avg weekly. Most were Eth but not all and so I pondered would that be removed or not.

All Im saying, not just here, again we seem more open than most, but between finding something OG and fresh and trying to balance it w the sub's rules...for me, its harder than expected.

Im all ears to advice...Id love to make more Donut.
