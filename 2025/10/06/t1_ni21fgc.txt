Building a successful SocialFi token is about building a healthy eco-system with a fair sense of user reward for helpful/informative/relevant information, not a "spam for free money" concept.

And similarly, if an advertiser was to buy DONUT to run a campaign, they'd want users to actually engage with questions or actually using the product/service provided - if they see the sub is just spammy and the users have little to no understanding or interest in actually using the Ethereum eco-system, they'll advertise elswhere.
