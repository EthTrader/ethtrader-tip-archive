Well, there's already pretty solid rewards for doing so that have been quite profitable for participating users, but not everyone is that comfortable with DeFi.

I'd definitely support any proposal that took some of the reward allocations from Post submissions and added more to Liquidity incentives though, but there is already 6k+ DONUT a day being awarded. xD
