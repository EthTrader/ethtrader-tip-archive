>So we need a Mandatory participation if you are a top ten donut earner? Otherwise earn penalty:D

I'd say mandatory for all (5% of what they earn).

Otherwise, 50k DONUT from the post allocation can be awarded to those who contribute DONUT to the liquidity pool. 

I hope DBRimatt thinks about that seriously xD
