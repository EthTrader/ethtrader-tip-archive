My approach is providing ETH from multiple wallets into multiple protocols.

Both to help with staking decentralization, but also my own wallet security should shit hit the fan.

There are a lot of options currently for smaller ETH holders to contribute; as you have listed.

I avoid LIDO at all costs due to their large marketshare of staked ETH already;

Ether.fi and Everstake are currently 2 of my preferred platforms for liquid and pooled staking options.
