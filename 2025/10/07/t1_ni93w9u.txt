I've never used Robinhood, but there are some longer than normal waiting periods currently for validator queues. I think I Coinbase was estimating about 30-45 days in September.

Good luck, im sure it will free up soon, but it can defintely be stressful while you wait.

In the meantime, have some $DONUT
