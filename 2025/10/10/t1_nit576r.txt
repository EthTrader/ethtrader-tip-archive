Its pretty obvious to me that there are some parties in governments around the whole globe loves totalitarianism but they try to hide it from the public. Proof of this is EU wanting to be able to control every message, UK arresting people for stuff they said online, Germany doing the same if you officials from the gov, they also want digital coins like CBCDs, equivalent to what China is doing that allows them to forbid you from getting your paycheck if you are against their believes, now this, etc.

This is a serious threat to human freedom and potentially to humanity itself.
