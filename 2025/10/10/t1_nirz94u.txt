Thanks again for being here.

I will tag u/0xMarcAurel u/DrRobbe  and u/kirtash93 again as reddit has an anti-spam measure that doesn't send tag notifications if a submission has more than 4+ user tags :)

Looking forward to the Leaderboards too; I'd really like to see this project take off and gain more reviews from users who have been in the space for several years.
