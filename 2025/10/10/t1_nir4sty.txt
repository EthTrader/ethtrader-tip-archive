It's interesting how SocialFi tokens like Moons and Donut have changed mindsets. Some users purely interact with those relevant subs because "free tokens" and never interact on any other sub on all of reddit. 

People can engage a little more casually as well without tipping, but often don't. 

That's okay though, nobody is forced to be active or inactive, and overall the general quality and substance of submissions is far less spammy and much more authentic than previously.
