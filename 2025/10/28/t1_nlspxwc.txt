I'm not a fan of X personally, but I would definitely support more integration of DONUT reward into X. I would support taking a small amount of DONUT per round, 50k for example, away from the Post Distribution Rewards and shuffling those into X rewards.

Would needs some disucssions with our devs to see how we can go about some sort of things. 

It would be great to continue to DONUT expansion and reach new audiences, and promote Ethereum!
