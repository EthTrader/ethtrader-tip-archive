> Why do we get more contrib than donuts? Some of the top guys have around 3x contrib in the table.

In general DONUT and CONTRIB is earned at a 1:1 ratio.

However;

DONUT cap: Currently the maximum DONUT one can earn is 42500 per round, excess DONUT are burned. But they still get the CONTRIB they would have earned.

Post of the Week bonuses. Additional CONTRIB is awarded for Post of the Week rewards

Governance bonuses: Additional CONTRIB is awarded for voting in governance

Adjusted Multiplier Rewards: Users that have sold more than 25% of their earned DONUT, have an adjusted multiplier value. This affects their DONUT reward only.
