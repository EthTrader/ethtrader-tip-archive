Wow, this is a pretty cool website and a great concept!

Let's say I sign up, I am a user with over 1000 days on-chain experience.

Let's say I was to leave a review for Crypto.com and I'm just mad because i bought some CRO and sold at a loss, so I want to give Crypto.com Exchange a bad review - Do you also need proof that I have actually used the platform?

While you're here, feel free to register your wallet for $DONUT - you could even earn some more and run a 2nd campaign at a later date :D
