Do you have measures in place to detect wrong scoring?   
Lets say i create 100 wallets, all review a shit coin to a nice score, would you detect it ?  
Basically how will you detect real users and reviews?  
I assume if the userbase is not large enough this is prone to be manipulated. 

  
Do you have any cooperation currently or planned with CEX, DEX or Coins?
