It’s coming… institutions just push price down and gobble up as much as possible before the big price appreciation. 

Millions of ETH is shorted in defi atm. So price is artificially held down. 

Besides… some institutions spend lots of money in sending ETH nodes into space. Ethereum is leading the race in becoming the future of finance for space travelers between earth, moon, mars wich is the 3 “planned habited planets” 

It’s pretty known that there is plans to inhabit moon and mars. Now with Ethereum running in space already… wich network will be used if no other competitors show up?
