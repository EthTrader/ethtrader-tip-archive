Sounds like something I wrote in 2021… 

Smart contracts were not built for humans.
They are built for the robots wich are owned or mastered by humans. 

Now you can do a few trades here and there… but there is no chance you can trade as fast or do as many trades per second as a super AI.

Ethereum is building for the future!
