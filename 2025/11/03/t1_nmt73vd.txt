The hate likely comes from some of the extreme control that dictating governments could enforce.

EG, your funds will expire, your funds can not be used in certain counties, stores etc.

It's just more programmable then the current form of currency.

It might not actually be that bad, but the potential for extreme dystopia does exist.
