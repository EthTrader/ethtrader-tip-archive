I do not completely disagree with you but.. that was just a consensus fork to recover funds which gave birth to ETC as the immutable chain. Pre-mine was 72M ETH and 60M of that was sold publicly through the ICO. Distribution is decentralized and not held by insiders. Do not forget Ethereum's security comes from validators and not a "central issuer.'
