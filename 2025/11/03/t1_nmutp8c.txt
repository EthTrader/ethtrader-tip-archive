> 3. Making the Donut DAO an Ethereum validator, with DONUT rewards for stakers

What a great idea and I think I would personally participate with my ETH. This idea only has advantages, it is very well thought out. About DONUT burns we should try to aim for nearly 1M monthly, that would be ideal for tokenomics. Happy cake day Marc!!
