Yeah DAI is a much better option, the problem is that it is not as widely adopted as Circle or Tether. If you really have to choose then use DAI because it is decentralized and unfreezable. I would love a privacy-stablecoin however it would never be regulated or adopted unfortunately, especially considering that we are moving towards an era of digital surveillance. Take Monero for example it is banned everywhere but at least that means it works.
