RE: #3

If we got this off the ground, not only can the treasury increase it's ETH holdings for future developments, but we could also allocate a portion of it for more DONUT buybacks.

Holding additional ETH would help diversify the treasury holdings as well as incentivizing more community members to get involved in staking to support the Ethereum network too.

Happy cakeday mod!
