Its funny that most of people believes that bank transfers are instant. Well, its all fake and most of the times when they tell you it is instant its also fake. They are just painting things in database to show you that it moved instantly while in the back a whole process of accountability/lending is happening. Main reason why sometimes they can rollback stuff too that use to happen with chargebacks messages in the back, etc. In the end, all those digits you see are "magic" too

Totally different with crypto, when you see it in your wallet, it is in your wallet which is magic too but its the whole base of crypto, its magical
