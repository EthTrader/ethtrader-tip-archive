Some may not like this answer, but when 50% of the country stops detesting the other 50% and vice versa; and we begin to act like the Americans we all are, and get something done for the better of society as a whole. 

Im not so sure we can anymore. We are (govt and the people)too bogged down with serious fiscal/economic issues and moral issues... who will have money, time, and the gump to think about Defi/Blockchain. Think the next TRUE (not some bubble we seem to specialize in creating) bull run will come from more Asia, and China and there actions w Crypto. They are more WE, not ME culture. A bigger middle class, that can afford to invest.

We shall see.
