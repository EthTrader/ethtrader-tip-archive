Is this a good time to suggest, maybe broaden the community guidelines a bit? I think there a bit restrictive. After all, crypto/blockchain...all of this, is new tech...evolving, shouldnt our community do the same?  You adapt in this world or get left behind...go the way of the Neanderthal.

Well my neighbors prove not all Neanderthals are gone.

Thanks, Good Post, surely needed.
