Highly recommend a bit of diversification.

I'm probably 60/40 in BTC favour, but it appears to becoming more a reality that BTC is the "store of value" and ETH is a tool to use DeFi to make gains.

Whether you are trading, liquidity providing, lending or staking - each with it's own set of risk, but each with it's own set of reward potential.
