Yes, staked ETH has only decreased very little last 6 months.   
and and by the looks of it more people are buying ETH than selling it. were just dragged down by BTC and crypto institutions and whales atm. Im not expert but i would say this is the usual bussiness at this time of the BTC cycle.   
  
With people shouting AI bubble and stock market cooling off. We might go lower or quickly recover our climb if sentiment change again.  We touched Extreme fear in fear and greed index... that usually shows a sign of good buying opportunity. 

Time will tell i guess. Every BTC cycle will have less and less impact, and whenever BTC stops dropping ETH seems to quickly recover. 

dont get me wrong... i hope for some sweet discount. But i think there is a reason why some say "BTC and ETH entered a super cycle" 

The inflation of BTC and ETH is super low atm, The inflation of BTC is currently a bit higher than ETH and remains so until next BTC halving. 

To return to the topic. i think we might see a new ATH of staked ETH within 6 months.
