yep. But i heard people taking profits during summer time- july-aug. so plenty of time to exit the validators there. But yeah. it would suck if you wanted to exit 5 weeks ago and just see the price decline and finaly can sell today.   
  
but a lot also seems to want to enter at these discount prices.
