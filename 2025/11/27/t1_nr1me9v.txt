There are 2 sides here, BlackRock holds more treasury exposure than most TradFi funds dared to touch a year ago. This can be good because yield attracts capital and that capital gets converted into more on-chain credit and the loop repeats. My only concern is the possibility of L2 fragmentation and centralization risks, we do not want institutions like BlackRock controlling the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
