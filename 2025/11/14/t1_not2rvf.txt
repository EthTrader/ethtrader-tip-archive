if you did DCA then you should be net positive still or be up quite a bit next time it goes on a bull run.  But sorry that you regret it. There is still other things to do in life.

But people say diversify... though i didnt quite feel good about investing in memes or random chains. i allways study a coin before jumping in. ETH did me well, alltough i got hacked and lost it all wich sucked. i returned with greater confidence and knowledge. 

there is a difference on how you look at it. ETH sold at 3k instead of sold for 4.5k or buying ETH at 3k and selling at 4.5k next time.   
  
But hey.... i know many people right now is hoping for BTC 20k and ETH 2k. they want cheaper prices. lets see whats going to happen.. the markets never sleep though.
