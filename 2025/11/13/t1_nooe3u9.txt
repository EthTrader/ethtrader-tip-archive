Yes. And there is ways to make donut a bit less volatile and at the same time give it a lot more volume. 

I’ve been advocating that there is a bit more changes that can be done for donut to appreciate in price and recognition for a long time. 

Feels sleepy here atm. 

A higher market cap by inflating donuts won’t fix the volatility. 

But there are other ways. 100% legit ways.
