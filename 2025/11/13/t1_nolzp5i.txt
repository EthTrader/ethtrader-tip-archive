I think the market overall is changing. Serious investors look for yield and that is why ETH is getting a lot of adoption. However providing liquidity with DONUTs also gives yield so perhaps we can use that?? The problem is it is a lot more volatile than ETH lol but that would also change with a higher market cap.
