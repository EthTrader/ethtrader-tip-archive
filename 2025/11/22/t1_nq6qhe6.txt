You don’t have to reset your custom flair if you’re a subscriber btw, just resub a day or so before your active subscription expires and you’ll keep the same flair.

But yea, the new 500K flair would be permanent. To change it, users would send a mod mail, at least until the automated flair command allows people with >500K GW to edit it.
