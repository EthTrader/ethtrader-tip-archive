Yes, I like this idea. Personally I dont need it, I will keep buying the special membership to get the other extra perks.

Just brainstorming here because just woke up with this thing in my head. Feel free to take the idea and elaborate it more.

Some sort of DONUT airdrop that will be based on the activity that users have in the community and the requirements are something like having registered a wallet in after 01/01/2025 and/or have less than 10K DONUT/10K CONTRIB or something like that. Obvious goal: Try to push activity even if that increases the risk of bad behaviors. Of course each wallet can earn a max of X DONUT and the Airdrop amount could be monthly and maybe based on half of the DONUT get burned each distro?

What do you think? I think it could be a good idea to try to boost the community
