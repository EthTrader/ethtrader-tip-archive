Agree. I'd love to see a larger trading contest, with actual blockchain record and a fresh audience of traders - was disappointing the 2 I oversaw manual only had 2 and 4 participants in each season.

I'd also still like to see the EthTrader staking help reward community members, as well as strenghten our own treasury position.

Exciting times ahead!
