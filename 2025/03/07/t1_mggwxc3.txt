I have stablecoins for some swapping some smaller cap tokens which only had a stablecoin pairing.

I have also, on a very short term basis, used stablecoins when swing trading to try and make profit with my ETH.

And of course, liquidity pools, which is another way of using stablecoin to assist in trading while gaining some additional revenue via fees too.
