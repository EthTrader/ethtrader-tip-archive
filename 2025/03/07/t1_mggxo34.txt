Nice idea... But will the ETH holding only be ties to the mainnent? I can make a prove I have certain ETH but I'll prefer if we can expand the ETH holding from mainnent to layer2s and sidechains.

Sending ETH on mainnent from exchange requires lots gas fees and I'm too poor to pay gas for that![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|rage)

So I'll rather transfer ETH from BYBIT straight to my wallet using ARB, polygon, optimism etc than using mainnent. If this proposal gonna pass, consider adding sidechains and layer2s please ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
