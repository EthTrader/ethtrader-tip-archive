I currently hold tether on BYBIT. I usually do say it before too because I don't get the idea of stablecoins. But its better to hodl it sometimes if you're a trader and you don't currently want to invest on any coin yet. Just hodl and wait for the certain coin to dip and then buy with your stablecoin
