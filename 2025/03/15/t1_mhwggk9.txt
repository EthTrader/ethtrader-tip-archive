>, the top three ETH-promoting tweets by reach, i.e. likes and reposts, are deemed the winners of the contest

What about the possibility of people using bot comments and retweet? it's a good idea but can we like use influencers instead and pay them with donuts? Having contest for the bronuts of the sub is a good idea but still the donut is going back to the wallets of already own donut wallets.

  
We needs more users outside reddit??? the reason most RCPs aren't known outside this platform is because most cryptobros doesn't use reddit, they prefer twitter and discord.

  
If we can be able to advertise donut to people on twitter/discord server, it'll bring in exposure but we just needs to be careful with influencers as well as most influencers uses bot likes and retweet as well.
