I just made my move. I used BTC as a hedge against ETH on polygon, it was previously there as amwBTC just getting interest, I sold back to ETH while the rsi was low. I kept it there for a highly volatile trade. Now it's back on mainnet in rETH where it's going to sit and will rely on staking to continue growing value. This is a similar dip to 2022 and 2019, so there's a good recovery chance. BTC has outperformed everything, it was originally there as a game wallet for aavegotchi. Suddenly ETHBTC has a low rsi so I swapped it. I consolidated all altcoins, only one of the expiry trades worked. At time of writing ETH is 1866.71 holy shit. Not gonna get a better deal than today if you believe in the tech. I wonder why the price is tanking though. 2019 implies coronavirus. It was mostly game money anyways so I won't really lost anything.
