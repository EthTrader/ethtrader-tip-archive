The real question is: Are you in a rush to need that money for anything right now or you can wait? If you can wait HODL should be easy.

In my case I need to buy a flat by 2026 so I am saving fiat now to reach the goal to be able to take a loan so in the worst crypto and stocks scenario I can HODL all without a forced sell.

Ethereum is the future OP.
