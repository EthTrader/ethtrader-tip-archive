If they keep banning people/org discriminating against crypto, wouldn't it sounds like they're trying to force many people to the crypto world? And once you started forcing people, people lose interest in whatever you're trying to force em to do and cryptocurrency will be globally hated. >!just like how the LGBTQ community is once hated, because they're trying to force their beliefs on everyone!<

I would say, whoever discriminate against crypto should just be left out. They're still people who think buying petrol for car is bad idea(so they prefer Tesla kinda car) but that doesn't stop the oil market to keep booming
