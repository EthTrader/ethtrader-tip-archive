I see, you're all about that "privacy" excuse for keeping your money on a non-KYC exchange like MEXC. You believe KYC CEX is sketchy and decided to use a non KYC CEX. But we all know the reason why, it's just a flimsy excuse for your risky behavior. 

 Good luck keeping your money in the land of anonymity where you can trade to your heart's content without ever having to reveal your true identity. But don't come crying later when SKETCHY MEXC decided to freeze your 100k
