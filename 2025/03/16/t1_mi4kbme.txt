Yea their effects are small but they are noticeable. Like you can calculate that ethereum is worth $100-$200 more because of the merge. And this one will probably have a bump due to being able to pay the gas fees in altcoins, so a lot of people too cheap to pay gas may finally move their "stuck" altcoins at no extra cost of moving eth to those wallets. So some money will be moved around, gas fees burn, maybe things will get better.
