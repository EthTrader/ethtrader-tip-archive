End of the day, if you can't identify where yield actually comes from.

Thats where I like volatile periods of high trading volume; to make use of liquidity pools, particularly if there is additional farm given in the form of either network or DEX governance tokens.

But these times don't last forever.

Otherwise, simple native staking is the safest/natural yield you can go for. Staking to support the network, beats unreliable lending protocols.
