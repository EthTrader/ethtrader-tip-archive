>People can criticize Vitalik Buterin all they want, but at least he keeps his consistent beliefs and values in the crypto space

I don't even get the criticism behind Vitalik's. The crypto OGs knows Vitalik hard work and what he has done for the development of ETH. People who bitch on him are just pained the coin they bought aren't rising which is actually affecting me as well but I'll never blame Vitalik. 

Vitalik isn't responsible for ETH low price, didn't people realize ETH is decentralized?
