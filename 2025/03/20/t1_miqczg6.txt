Community/Governance tokens like DONUT was my stepping stone into the world of DeFi. A nice risk free introduction that helped me learn without investing any initial capital. Prior to that, I kept all my crypto on a CEX.

As I learned, gained confidence and understanding and explored DeFi, I have gained experience in staking, range trading, liquidity provision, airdrop hunting etc.

Now, I have all of these strategies under my belt and can incorporate options as I see fit.

IMO, any and all these things do help support and grow the Ethereum Ecosystem.

Have a DONUT.
