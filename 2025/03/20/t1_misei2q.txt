Airdrop hunting actually proved to be quite profitable; some of the better results were spending up to $30-40 in gas fees and earning $400-500 worth of token.

But, results will vary, some people did a LOT of network activity and didn't fair any better then others, depending on the unknown criteria.

I think good airdrops are a thing of the past though, projects seems to know how to milk users with fomo xD

But again, it's all been a good learning experience too!
