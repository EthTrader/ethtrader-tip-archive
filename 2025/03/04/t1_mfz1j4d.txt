Now that I have more time and energy to be more active, the earnings cap would impact me. I am ok with that and will still vote [YES] because that means more folks get to participate and earn more DONUTs too. I used to earn less than 10,000 DONUTs in a round last year so anything above that is a great bonus and a blessing for me.
