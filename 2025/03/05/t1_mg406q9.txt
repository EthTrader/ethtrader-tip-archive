I still don't know why they haven't added lots of countries to the program as reddit is a world-wide platform. I hope after the USA SEC NFTs issues have solved, hope they added more countries to the program. 

I love when we discuss about the web3 program on this platform but I hope reddit never abandon it.
 Because since the announcement of going public and after they do, they've been doing shitty decisions on it web3. Sunsetting rcps, selling their Bitcoin and ETH holding before the pump and now the head of the program left as well

I hope they reconsider their web3 goals and focus on it again 

Nice post BTW.
