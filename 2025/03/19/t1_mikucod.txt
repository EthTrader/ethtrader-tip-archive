>Â Ethereum's price has dropped over 53% from its 2024 high, with its market cap falling from $482 billion to $227 billion

The interesting part is, the mcap of all other coins too are falling. If it's onlt ETH now, then I'll be worried, but so far is all coin, there's believe we gonna rise back up
