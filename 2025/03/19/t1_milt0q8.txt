>What are these undistributed donuts actually comprised of?

Mainly from users who were site-wide or sub banned, or didn’t meet the account requirements for that round.

Also Pay2Post is essentially a tax, it doesn’t directly translate into Donuts. Instead, when you post, a portion of x DONUT is deducted from your distribution score for that round.

>I also assume, for example, [u/Kirtash93](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kirtash93/) earns 100k DONUT from the distro, and is capped at approx 42k, those 60k will get burned if this is implemented?

With the new earnings cap and the way the distribution ratio works, those excess tokens wouldn’t be burned. Instead, they would be redistributed among other users.

The cap is designed to benefit less active users while penalizing aggressive farming, making the distribution more balanced.
