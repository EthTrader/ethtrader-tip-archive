We can't technically mint new tokens whenever we want.

The smart contract controller operates on a timer, which mints exactly 20,880,000 DONUT when the treasury runs out of reserves. After that, new tokens can only be issued again after exactly one year.

So, it's inflation, but controlled inflation, I guess.
