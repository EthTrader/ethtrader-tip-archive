> But the actual number of distributed Donuts is usually a little lower than this amount, which leaves us a surplus that stays in the treasury.

What are these undistributed donuts actually comprised of?

Pay2Post fees?

I also assume, for example, u/Kirtash93 earns 100k DONUT from the distro, and is capped at approx 42k, those 60k will get burned if this is implemented?
