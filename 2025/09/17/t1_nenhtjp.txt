Looks really clean and I think every needed information is there or at least linked. 

Maybe we could also link apps/homepage and git repos from the donut eco system. So people can see that there is dev activity.

- Donut dashboard
- Mydounts-online 
- Official Git hubs of reddito & matt (we could also display l monthly committs or similar)
- Member git hubs Kirt & myself (not sure about this point)
