It’s exactly why they made the validator exit queue. Ethereum devs are known to implement smart and well thought through decisions from start. 

They don’t rush faulty stuff.

It’s both a feature and a safety measure. Say you hear that you are getting robbed in 1 week… you have time to prepare. (If someone else than you exits your validator) 

A good explanation. Well done. 👏
