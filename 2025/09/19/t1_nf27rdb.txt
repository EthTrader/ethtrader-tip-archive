A similar concept can apply to us as crypto investors/traders/users.

I would not want 100% on my ETH being staked either, not just because then I wouldn't be able to use it, but also, worst case, I do something stupid and let myself get exploited/scammed/hijacked.

> We need balance, that is what makes staking different from just another yield farm.

Just like this post addresses, I diversify my Ethereum by contributing to staking across 2 different protocols, lending via AAVE, LPing in a couple of different pools, and of course, having liquid funds as well, ready to trade as needed.
