The "Adjusted DONUT rewards for users transferring over 25% of lifetime earnings" didn't help.

Donuts were supposed to be a content reward system. No they are trying to tell people what you can & cannot do with your rewards. It's idiotic in itself. It also goes diametrically against the blockchain ethos that values personal freedom above all else.

I'm not "inactive" but this thing definitely reduced my interest in this sub. To whom it may concern.
