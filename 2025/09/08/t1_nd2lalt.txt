> as the top two are already on CEXs

Moons may have been listed on CEX... but they have also been delisted from CEX.

MEXC moons can are effectively their own token, unable to be deposted or withdrawn out of the CEX - manipulated by trading bots and fake volume.

I think CDC have delisted moons too.

Kraken moons are on Arbitrum Nova, which is a dying blockchain in it's own right.
