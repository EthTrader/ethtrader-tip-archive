That's also why paying for an exchange listing is often never a good idea, once that initial "oh new token has been listed, trade it" happens, when trading volume returns to organic levels, tokens often find themselves delisted. And then the price has dumped below their pre-listing value.

That's why it's important to improve existing TVL and trading volume first.
