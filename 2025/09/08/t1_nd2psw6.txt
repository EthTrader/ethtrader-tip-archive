I wasn't aware that, but I checked and it seems you are right.

Valid point! I think that limits MOON the most. Otherwise, on a better blockchain it could easily achieve a much higher price, volume and market cap.

Anyways, it still linked with r/CC, which gives them extra visibility or attention as compared to other RCCs.
