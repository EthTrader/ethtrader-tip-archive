Possibly. Hard to say because concentrated ranges are calculated to a higher weight. 

That's why Memey's position, despite being about half as much in DONUT and ETH to the Multisig-Treasury, is calculated to be about 33% of the pool, while the Treasury is 9%. 

I'm not sure what Memey's range selection is.
