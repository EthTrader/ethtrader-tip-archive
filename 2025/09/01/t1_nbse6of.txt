Mayb, ite would be great to get back to the numbers from 2-3 years ago. We saw way more active registered users back then.

I also feel that new users often don't tip anything. Even when they interact on topic etc. maybe they don't know they can use the CMD right away... I will look into it and create a statistic for that.
