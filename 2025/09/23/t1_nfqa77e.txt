Yes, they did.

Thats my view as well, theres nothing wrong with making the generic comment and giving the tip to the OP.

But the "reciprocal tipping" is when the OP tips back in return, which is what we are trying to stamp out when its just spam and filler content. This is very different to when a couple of users engage in in depth discussion.
