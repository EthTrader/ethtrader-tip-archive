Many new crypto (Launched in 2022/23 and later) could well make new ATH's, but many of those that were launched 2021 and earlier, fair chance they won't.

Doesn't mean that they won't make good gains from their low prices either. 

With so many more tokens existing now, BTC Dominance can decrease and many tokens won't make individuals highs, despite a total marketcap high too.

Lot's to take into consideration!
