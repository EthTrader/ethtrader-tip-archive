It's worth paying attention to for sure, but also worth noting; tokenization can lead to a lot more transactions, and stablecoin value being locked on Ethereum. More TVL doesn't necessarily mean ETH will go up in price either.

More trading volume doesn't mean price goes up either, but it can help keep burn rates in line with issuance rates from staking.
