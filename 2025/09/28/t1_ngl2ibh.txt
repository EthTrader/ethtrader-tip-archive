This is coming into my 2nd cycle, and I've definitely made some mistakes in both ways, selling too soon, and not selling soon enough.

But one thing I've maintained conviction on is ETH in the long-term, which is why a good portion of mine is locked away staking!

Have some $DONUT, EthTraders SocialFi token!
