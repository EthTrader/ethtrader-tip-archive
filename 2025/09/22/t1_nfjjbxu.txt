No minimum, I showed $4 in my example, as $2 of ETH and $2 of DONUT.

But, like everything else in crypto, risk and reward are relative.

I think I was the same the very first time I ever participated in a liquidity pool, was about $10, and slowly learned along the way about the balance changes, rewards etc.

The fact you can learn about it, and experience it first hand with tokens one earned for free is just a bonus which reduces some of the risk of capital investment.
