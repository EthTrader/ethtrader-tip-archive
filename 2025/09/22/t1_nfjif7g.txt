Honestly, I only bought and never sold any. 
My only regret is not buying more when the price was sub 100$ in Dec. 2018 at that time I had Fiat laying around and I remember standing in the kitchen holding my phone in my hand and wanting to press Buy on the exchange,,,, but didn't. Why didn't I do it? Idk.. but anyways,, after that I had other priorities so buying with fiat wasn't an option anymore.

I live by this quote: "you only lose, when you sell". I believe in Ethereum and the tech. so it is easy for me to live by this quote. 

My advice in bear markets: Stop looking at prices, reddit, etc. and enjoy your time until the market recovers then you can get excited again ;)
