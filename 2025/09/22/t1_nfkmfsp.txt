Thanks for the inspiration!

To match consistency of comparing previous weeks, I might remove the 24 hour volume, and replace it with "last weeks 7 day volume" and "this weeks 7 day volume".

This will match the fact I look at the 7 day price adjustment of ETH/DONUT and last weeks DONUT/ETH price ratio too.
