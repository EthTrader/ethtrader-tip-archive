Last 10 posts I made got deleted I think. And I’m not into what some does to cheat the system by making a invisible section with “spamspamspam”

All the various rules to make a post just kills it for me. So I’m comment only from now on. Too expensive to try and make a post. And meme posts are only for special members too so. 🤷‍♂️

Donut and ethtrader is still cool. Just spend less time here and never make posts anymore.
