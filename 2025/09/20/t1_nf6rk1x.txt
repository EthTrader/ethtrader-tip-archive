Well and truly over.

Approx 3-4% is the native stake reward rate - which means anything above that is generating their yield some other way. Lending platforms can fluctuate, they rely on people borrowing.

Dodgy lending platforms end up running like ponzi's, what you supply is to pay for someone elses yield, until it eventually collapses, especially if there arn't that many people actually borrowing to generate the interest payments to cover the lending rewards.
