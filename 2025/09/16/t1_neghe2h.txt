Personally, I liked the fact Base didn't have a token.

Besides, being affiliated with Coinbase, I can't imagine a huge decentralized governance token is what they would have wanted.

But, I suppose a native token does allow them to hand out grant money for other devs and projects without awarding ETH or USDC directly.
