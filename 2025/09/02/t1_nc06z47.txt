There are pro's and con's to each.

But; my 3 top suggestions are

1) Coinbase  
It's a centralized exchange, you can get better APY's elsewhere, but there no on-chain gas costs. They are the chosen custodian of Institutions, so there is an element of trust there.

2) [Everstake.one](http://Everstake.one)   
pooled staking, on-chain gas fees, like anything, there is risk with smart contract, but has been very reliable in my experience. 

3) [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) liquid staking/restaking platform, can offer decent APY's, chance of airdrops with other tokens, additional risk with liquid tokens
