Buy the dip or not… as always. It’s up to you. 

It’s all about entry and exit points. Now if you want to take profits at 21k then I guess you won’t stop buying now. 

Some go for the short 2x some paperhands for the short 0.5x. But if you make a solid plan and stick too it… it might just work out. If I were to take profits when ETH is 21k I would likely buy and DCA all the way up to 19k and wait for it to hit 21.
