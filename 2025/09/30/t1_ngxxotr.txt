I hope ADA has a prosperous and successful future; but it simply pales in user numbers compared to ETH. Hydra doesn't have the same level of adoption and Ethereum's scaling solutions.

I stake a good chunk of ADA still, but other than that, I can't say I've actually used the network in years. 

You do raise good questions though, and it's important not get into too much of an echo-chamber - but I certainly don't answer those more technical points, but my user experience with Ethereum is the reason why it's my primary cryptocurrency network.
