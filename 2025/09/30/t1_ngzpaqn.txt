This is the big selling point. As I said, I've opted for "day trading" making trades within minutes of each other from relatively small price movements.

But, I could still easily see myself get sidelined, or forced to buy back at a loss, and undo what profits have been taken so far.

I'll probably write a piece about the psychology of it later as well once I've spent a few weeks at it.

But, I'm definitely not going to be sitting staring at the charts for hours on end, I still have full time work, sport and other commitments in life to juggle - which is where the passive income is a HUGE advantage.

Should be an interesting experiment nonetheless!
