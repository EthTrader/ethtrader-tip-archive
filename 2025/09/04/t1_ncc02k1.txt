I bet they do...haha..(honestly prob more chances in US than overseas, none the less),  say I fix a Network Issue or Wifi for a local cafe, and they pay me cash, some places not best to carry cash. Being able to dump in a wallet fast would be nice, but Im thinking Id find a...CashApp depositor before I find an Eth Atm anyway...but, anyone reading this w some serious money or intrest in such..maybe worth exploring.
