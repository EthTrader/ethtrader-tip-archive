You are absolutely right, it is incredibly difficult for new and small projects to find exposure and take off. Most subs will remove the unknown out of uncertainty of being an illegitimate product, or due to anti-advertising or self promotion rules.

You can check out r/ethdev if you are looking to bounce ideas off, but it sounds like you're simply ready to get your project out there.

Both r/EthTrader and r/Cryptocurrency offer "advertising/marketing campaigns" where you buy and burn the SocialFi token implemented in the sub $DONUT and $MOON - you can reach out via Modmail for more specific discussion on the costs and other details. Naturally, these will also have mixed results depending on the project and overall sentiment from users.

But, projects have to start somewhere - and in a space that is ever growing with previous rugpulls, scam tokens and bad actors, it does make it difficult for even those with good intentions to get started and make traction.

Welcome to EthTrader, feel free to register your Ethereum address for said SocialFi token, $DONUT
