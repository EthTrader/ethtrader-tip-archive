I was going mention already stated advertising options...Ok...I think Im not violating rules here, since post is genuinely asking a question, and we all seem to agree, there is a need, a issue to be resolved...Im not trying plug my coin, but I wouldnt care if you posted on my community page, for a coin I made on PumpFun, that myself and 2 friends have been goofing around with. (Hell maybe that should be our business...haha) But that said, Id be facing same issue myself, how to advertise, esp when this is community is all about Ethereum but, my offer(as strictly a favor...plus its not much exposure, its me and 2 friends) but as every one knows PumpFun is Solana...Damn Fine Good Question Mate! 
We should think of something.

A well earned
