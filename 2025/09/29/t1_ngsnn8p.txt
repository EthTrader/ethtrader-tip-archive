Arbitrum's lead in the L2 ecosystem is undeniable, but it is very close to Base if we look at the data. Arbitrum has very low fees and a high TVL, it also has very good developers so that is why it is Ethereum's number one scaling solution. It is also my favorite L2 for obvious reasons (DONUTs :D).
