I would be more than happy to see 50k DONUT get taken out of the Post Distribution and be added to the LP personally, but, I'm not winning that proposal any-time soon xD

But for me, a big factor is, DONUT earned from LP is not DONUT calcuated towards 'Earned DONUT' in regards to the adjusted multiplier. 

That means the 400-500k DONUT i've earned from the LP in the last year or so, I can sell, without reducing my multiplier score.
