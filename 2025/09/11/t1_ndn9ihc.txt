Prob will, and honestly past 15yrs, My bank accounts are with a small bank and small credit union...there is a WORLD of difference w them, as opposed prior the 15years when I was with big banks. (Once went into a Citibank in NYC w $1000 dollars to start an account, Branch Manager literally laughed at me and said "I dont think were what your looking for" (They wish they have my business today)

But as someone mentioned, banks will, should adapt...actually think for awhile, the smaller guys will fare best. Cause they are much more personable and can more easily adapt to there individual customers needs. (My debit card # got scanned, caught it b4 anything happened but needed a new card, but I was travelling and it had to go overnight to different address, etc...one phone call, actually talked to employee putting my card in envelope)

Could you imagine Wells Fargo or Bank of Anerica doing that? No way....Wouldnt be surprised if employee w either would say "And how is this my problem"
