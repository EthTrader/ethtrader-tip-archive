I'm always a fan of seeing the ZK-Rollups gain some tracction.

From a user perspective, really can't say that there's anything about any of the chains that really stand out over the other, they are all L2 rollups, that are much faster and cheaper to use than mainnet.

I'd be curious to hear from devs that have built projects if they notice any particular differences between L2 networks.

I'm guessing you also qualified for the airdrop that is currently able to be claimed now too.
