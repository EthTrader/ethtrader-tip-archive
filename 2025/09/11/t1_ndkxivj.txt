I'd say, less than $20 spent on gas fees and NFT's resulted in about $600 worth of airdrop rewards, plus of course, the time.

But some of those transactions were me trading USDC to ETH and back, and making profits as well, as well as providing single asset liquidity in concentrated ranges to trade and take rewards.

All in all, absolutely worth it.
