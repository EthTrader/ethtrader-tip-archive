It was everything you expect and more. Im not much the Builder...(a little bit, at my pace) but the networking was great. I got to meet folks, Ive dealt with online for years but in person. Learned about things I had heard of but knew nothing about. Meet some folks like me, Crypto Nomads, a term Id never heard before...I had a nice time.

Some of the locals, knew my back story (from sidewalk to 6 figures in year) and so it was good to share my story. Some sat me down, gave me all sorts of free advice. I got to bounce stuff off of them.

Very similar to Bitcoin Pizza Day Party here in Denver I also went to. It was at a really nice art gallery. Meet artists, some good laughs, free booze and pizza...I didnt want to leave or for it to end...haha.
