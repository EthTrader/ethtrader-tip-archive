Absolutely, I mentioned in another comment, my user-experience has pretty much been the same with all L2's - I'm not a dev, so ease of that type of stuff doesn't impact me.

ZK's have been slightly more expensive than the Optimistic rollup, but I do believe the ZK's will continue to develop, and one of them (My moneys on ZkSync) to make way.

But, end of the day, it'll come down to what projects build on what network, for whatever reason, and that could come down to who gives grant money out xD
