The biggest topic next few days is prob going to be this huge dip. I was surprised myself when I researched % of people unstaking today. Some Exchanges actually posting warning about tx times. If so many unstaking, prob means more dip to come??

I have a half dozen reasons/thoughts why...rate cut, holiday season, a lot of strife in the world and at home...you know what...who cares why, maybe a little of each. Its down, its buy and hodl time and thats it. Is what it is.

Again, to all you new folks, dont paniac, might take awhile but still feel...I know... good things to come w ETH.
