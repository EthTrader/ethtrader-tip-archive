I don't understand why people don't also join the LP pool when they see these numbers. 

You put 150k donuts in and made 140k donuts via fees and rewards. It basically impossible to suffer impermeable loss with these reward ratios.

if you keep this position another year you will have received more value in rewards than the total position amount you put into the pool including your ETH...
