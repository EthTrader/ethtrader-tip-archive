One of the more interesting metrics to keep an eye on, and if the "cyclical" nature of crypto continues to be a thing. Back in May the ratio was less than 0.02 for a short period of time; but has since shown strength in the last 5 months climbing back to nearly 0.04

If it continues to show some strength and outperform BTC over the next few months, we could be in for some euphoric times.
