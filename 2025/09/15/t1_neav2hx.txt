Just Reddit things...

I'm waiting for the day the DONUT DAO treasury grows, and we can make our own platform... with blackjack... and hookers!! 

And support the Reddit Avatars....

But, money doesn't grow on trees. It grows on the blockchain. 

Maybe DONUT DAO Forum will be on the Roadmap for 2035.
