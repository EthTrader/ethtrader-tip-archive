Sure, if you check the main metrics in most of them Ethereum is leading, though it didn't reflect on the price as expected.

Coming back to lending activity, I never did, but this shows the growing trust and adoption of Ethereum DeFi system in recent years. 
I think Aave is the main contributor to this growth.
