Binance was my CEX 2 years ago but I had a problem with them. This of course was in CZ's days, I know it's different now. They froze my account suddenly due to 'internal policies' and didn't allow me to withdraw my crypto. I had to threaten them with a complaint to the competent authorities in my country, and after hours of being stalled in the terrible customer support chat I eventually got in touch with a supervisor, and they let me withdraw. Never again!!
