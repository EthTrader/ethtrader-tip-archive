This is a great proposal and I think milting all distribution to have a max cap will be better.

I just feels like this isn't a better time to do this, as people on the sub aren't even much yet(but that's just my opinion, I didn't have any good reason to back it up)

Donut will be more valuable if it's rare to get and might increase a buying pressure as well

I'll [ABSTAIN] for now though
