Nah, I have been "fighting" with mods regarding this topic probably the whole cycle and first I came with the 25% idea with I think its fine but the "fight" kept developing and I kept hitting a wall regarding zerogpt gives 0% AI and others gives 100% AI but still mods dont act according to the already approved rule (the one I shared) centuries ago and after a friendly looooooooong discussion this proposal possibility popped up 2 days ago or so (if I am not wrong). So I decided to share this one today before I forgot about it xD
