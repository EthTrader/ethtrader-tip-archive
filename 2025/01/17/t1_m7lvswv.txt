I'll only host minigames on Daily's that I'm able to post around the time the daily is posted, the daily was already 25% expired by the time I was able to get here today - to allow the most fair and optimal participation. :)

I also have set amount of DONUT per round allocated for contests and these minigames, so I'll manage that accordingly between various activities.
