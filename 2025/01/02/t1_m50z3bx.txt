Trading volumn does look good, sadly price keeps dropping.
I think i will have a look at ratio compared to price and make a post about it, Because nowadays since the ratio had spiked you get more donuts per tip so even with the price drop you get more rewards $ wise. 
I will visualize this over a few distributions. That at least helps me not to worry as much about the actual price of donuts.
