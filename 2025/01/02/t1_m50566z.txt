I think we have a big inflation problem. We need to address this issue if we want to see donuts keep increasing it's value over time. Other than having 20k donut, there is no solid benefit of holding donuts. It keeps being distributed every 28 days and being sold by users every time. As I observed most of the users sell their donuts as soon as distribution happens and only keep around 20k. If we need to be realistic, why would anyone want to hold such thing? Let alone attracting investors who wants to buy it. I don't know maybe mods/devs want to keep it that way as it's a community token?
