More tips :


1. Only use money you can afford to lose.  
2. Beware of fake wallets disguised as real ones with 1,000 holders; they could be devs' wallets.  
3. Ensure liquidity is locked and the contract is burned.  
4. Check if the community is active and the devs have a good website and Discord.  
5. Avoid buying from honeypot contracts.
