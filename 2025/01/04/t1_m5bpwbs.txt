Not that decentralization isn't good but it's too complicated for people to understand. Most people prefer others saving funds for them with a promise of THEIR FUNDS IS SAFE with the bank, government etc 

Having access to your funds at your own will isn't bad but the folks doing decentralization is always afraid of hackers. Which is one reason why decentralized adoption might not be certain tbh
