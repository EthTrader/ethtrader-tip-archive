One thing I love about DEFI is the accessibility... It's open to everyone with internet without the need for banking infrastructure. And having control over your assets. Which is one reason I feels like we're still early because lots people haven't learned about Blockchain technology. Once they learn about how easy to be able to control users assets without the needs of banks, they'll prefer Blockchain than bank 🏦.
