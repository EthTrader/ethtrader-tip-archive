PEPE I bought back in the winter - I always thought it was going to have a good run when an uptrend finally came.

SNEK I was actually pretty late, I saw it was listed on major exchanges and decided to go for a quick buy in... but ADA just kept pumping, which took SNEK with it.

TURBO I just happened to stumble across, looked into it and thought sure, why the hell not! xD
