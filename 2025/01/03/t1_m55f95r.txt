Profit is profit right?

Yes, my current strategy is earn as much as possible for a flat this cycle with "low" risk like DCA etc.

Once I sell, save around $20k for next cycle and the rest for the flat so at least I can buy the bottom next winter with a "decent" amount of fresh cash. And the extra income coming from fiatnam saves keep adding it to investments and a little percentage to next gem search and other little amount for trading.

But well that will be next cycle and still trying to figure out if I will take a break before it xD
