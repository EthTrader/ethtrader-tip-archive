Donut current use case is a governance token. But I'll only type for more exposure.

I think we needs collaboration with some established companies and similar project to reach new users 

Host twitter space, where we can educate new people about Donut

Right now donut is listed on DEX, and on arbitrum one. It shows it's easier to buy & sell but not everyone love using DEX, so possible CEX listing will be great but we needs exposure first

We currently having AMAs with top investors recently, so KUDOS to Marc

As far as we won't want influencers to promote donut, I guess we need it. Pay this influencers with donut and let them promote donut to their followers, I guess we need a governance pool for that. Maybe every distro, a certain amount of donut won't be distributed, but instead use it to promote. 

We needs to organize donut giveaways outside of reddit and bronut shouldn't be part of the participants

And ensure those participants engage with the content, share it on their social media. (Like, retweet and follow. Just an example)

Cross promotion with other crypto project. Sharing each other's content for joint marketing :)
