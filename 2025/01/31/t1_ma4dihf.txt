Yes I am quite active these days. I have both Binance and Deribit.

Despite teaching alot on complex options structures I find single leg options (either buy call or buy put) to be the easiest. Sometimes simplicity is key I guess.

That being said - I feel long term nothing can beat a HODL portfolio, and I have most of my money in HODL ETH
