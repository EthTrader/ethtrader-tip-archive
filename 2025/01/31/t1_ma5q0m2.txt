I confirm this process. My bank also requires sending them full documentation before doing the transfer. Once they say "ok send it". I can withdraw.

In my case I have chosen Binance, I was scared about having to add my bank IBAN digit by digit too but the process is smooth. You just need to send a bank transfer to your Binance account (the one they give you) and it is automatically configured after that so I just have to select the option. Big relief.
