I only plan on cashing out a single digit percentage of my BTC & ETH holdings. More or even all on other projects.

In many ways I consider the two better than fiat and I have the discipline & financial freedom to play the long term game.

End of the decade I want to have more BTC & ETH than I have now & time in the market is better than timing it.
