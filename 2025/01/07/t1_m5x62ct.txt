Yes, you read it right but I am not sure if it applies to every chains or just polygon ones right now. I will paste you some sources with interesting data. Maybe you can find something there.

In one of the docs I found this

>The AggLayer currently connects chains built with Polygon CDK, a developer toolkit for designing ZK-powered Layer 2s. The long term goal for the protocol is to be flexible enough to provide interoperability among a growing range of blockchain architectures, including L2s, appchains, and non-EVM chains.

So the goal is to expand as much as possible.
