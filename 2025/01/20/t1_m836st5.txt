Everyone has to make the best decisions they can for their circumstances - and end of the day, investing comes down to luck, even with due diligence.

As disappointing as ETH's performance has been over the last year, especially when compared to BTC and some other alts, I don't think it is done, and it will have it's own phase where it will outperform other assets for a period of time.

In the meantime; I continue to stake and accumulate rewards from liquidity positions.

I have a reasonably well split position between BTC, ETH and Gold, and have a small amount of ETH set aside for trading memecoins.

I'm happy to play the long term game with the bulk of my ETH holding. Even though it hasn't had the best 12 months, ETH staking and rewards, plus the increased in value of the asset STILL outperforms leaving money in the bank earning interest.
