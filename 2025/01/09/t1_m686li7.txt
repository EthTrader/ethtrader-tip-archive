Since I got into crypto I have seen every kind of anti ETH propaganda. It reminds me to the bull runs when Binance locked my account, Coinbase locked my account, etc posts pop up on Reddit. All of them are pure paid noise.

From my point of view, I would love ETH foundation not selling but it is a business and they must sell top and buy low to pay their stuff. I would do the same xD Ethereum is a hell of a great project and its poised to be huge.

If they dump, I buy cheap. Simple
