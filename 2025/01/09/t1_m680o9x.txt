I guess the difference in ratio between Bitcoin and Ethereum holders is because of that BTC has surpassed its ATH multiple times (obviously, more holders preferred profits), while ETH has not yet reached its previous ATH so long-term holders prefer to keep ETH.

Wen ETH will cross the previous ATH, then the comparison will be more reasonable.
