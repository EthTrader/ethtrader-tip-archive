People that dont believe or lose hope on ETH is because they are not paying attention to the real things like adoption trends, etc. and they are falling under the price action and noise.

The only reason why I am 100% into crypto since 2021 is because I ONLY checked adoption trends and correctly interpretated every action governments took to FUD, try to stop it, etc. All those things are signs of what to do.

People forget that governments are not our friends or here to protect us. They are our enemies and they are here to control and milk us.
