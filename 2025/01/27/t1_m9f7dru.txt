My largest position is on Syncswap on ZKSync network.

Theres additional ZK incentives, plus hoping to earn more $SYNC when that eventually gets airdropped. [You can read more about the ZKIgnite Campaign here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i67oyg/exploring_zksync_zksync_ignite_campaign_season_1/)

I also have a smaller position on Sushi.com on Arbitrum network which currently has additional $SUSHI yield as well.
