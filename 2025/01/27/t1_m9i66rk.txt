I believe that AI is going to revolutionize the way we use things and make our life a lot easier for a lot of things. A lot of jobs will just evolve and become more efficient. What someone would take half an hour or more to search on google for a solution will require a few minutes but you still need the knowledge to know that what AI is telling you is right or wrong, that's where professional knowledge comes to play.

However AI can also be used for really bad stuff and this is why we also need clear regulations and laws to punish those who will use it the wrong way.

With all said, hail AI, and I hope Terminator doesn't become a documentary.
