I work as a Software Engineer and in private stuff like banking it will take quite a time to let us devs use AI unless its totally private and the server is under the bank control (currently they blocked the access to all kind of AI)

In terms of developing code, human will always be required because someone needs to read what AI writes and decide that it is what you want for the feature.
