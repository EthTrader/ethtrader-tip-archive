Okay! This is big!

First, thanks for holding an AMA in this amazing community and also thanks to the mod team that achieved somehow to make it possible too.

I have some questions:

1. Which country or region (e.g., Europe) do you believe has the clearest and most straightforward laws to follow?
2. What has been the most rewarding or challenging aspect of your role at Coinbase?
3. This one is a hot potato: Do you think the SEC's approach to crypto regulation has been constructive or counterproductive?

Thanks!
