I did some mining back in 2020/21 but I never any dedicated hardware, it was just my gaming PC putting in some time when I wasn't gaming. Even then, I simply "lent" my mining power by signing up to Nicehash, which secured me guaranteed profits, albeit tony profits.

So, once staking kicked it, that suited my equipment a hell of a lot better xD
