Here is the original proposal you can read.

Previously, $DONUT was awarded to users who received upvotes. This was subject to manipulation, downvotes, alt accounts, etc, which could be achieved anonymously.

Tip2Vote now means that in order to reward another user DONUT from the DAO, you must send that user a tip of alteast 1 DONUT.

Voting weight also means that new accounts can't just be created and award the "full weight" of a Vote to another user, instead they must slowly build towards 20k Governance score for their tips to have full weight.

Example. For asking this genuine question, I will reward you with a tip as well.
