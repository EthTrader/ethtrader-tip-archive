Wow, 6 years?? I had no idea DONUTs were this old. I've been here for almost 2 years now and it never crossed my mind. Should've done my homework xD. So I would like to take this moment to present a small criticism, please don't hate me.

When I joined Reddit I was a member of r/cc. I wasn't very active but I was online almost every day. The sub had a lot more people, looked organized and there was a lot less spam and shitcoin posts like we sometimes see here, even though it's way better here now. I think MOONs were as successful as they were because of the dedication of the r/cc mods and because there were more restrictions in certain aspects. I left r/cc after Reddit canceled MOONs and started being more active here. The mods are more relaxed and that can be a good thing, but it can also mean they are not as interested or as active, and that is bad for DONUTs because they're the ones promoting their growth.

My feedback would be that mods should be more present and do some marketing outside r/ethtrader, because let's be real nobody knows DONUTs except us. Other than this, I like everything about DONUTs and it's a little important piece of my life. c:
