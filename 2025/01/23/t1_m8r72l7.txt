Also, since you have say a governance score of >=20k
Your upvotes/karma (not tips) count as normal for the distro?
Alright and the tips you send me, since their weight is "1", I'm still eligible to receive say the ~40ish donuts based on estimated distro ratio? For the single donut tip you sent me?
I'm hoping to recoup my lost donuts this distro and have a clean slate again so I start participating normally and get to hold the donuts that I once lost....

Plus, the tips that I send to people, I feel really bad how they don't get as much karma because my tips aren't weighted
But why does this feel like this is more advantageous to me and disadvantageous to others since I get to be tipped normally mostly (every time I received today had a weight of 1) but my tips make less donuts for people because my governance is low- how does that make sense?
