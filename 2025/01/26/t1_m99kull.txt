>According to the Rainbow Chart, Ethereum will be worth around $9,595.7-$13,727.76 if it reaches the "But have we "earned" it? zone in 10/05/2025 and $6,590.27-$9,594.7 if it reaches the "Is this the "Flippening?" zone

Any of both instances is fine by me. Anything to get us out of this 3k stagnation is welcome
