Oof, it took me 10 minutes to read and process this proposal and here is my conclusion:

* This is very smart to do due to regulations now. It's better to organize things and play it safe.
* It's good to go beyond Reddit, if something happens to our dear sub DONUTs could be affected. Of course we don't want bad things to happen, but you never know and it's better to be prepared.
* Mods are clearly underpaid and overwhelmed.
* This is a professional and detailed proposal, it shows your dedication to the community.

I may be just a farmer with few DONUTs, but I support this totally and will help however I can. [YES]
