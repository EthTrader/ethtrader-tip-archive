**Happy 6th Birthday Anniversary Donut** 🎉🥳 🎂 🍩 🎆 🎊

**The Good**

Donut is a well-conceived project by founders who had and still have their hearts in the right place.

My exposure to Donut is barely a year old, but having gone through old posts or threads on this sub and from my personal experiences, I can boldly say interest in Donut wasn't/isn't necessarily about a few quick bucks. It wasn't even about love or ego but purpose!

Admittedly, in the past 7 months, Donut is something I wake up to help build (in my capacity as a creator by giving the sub that houses it good optics through quality content creation) and whose best interests I'd love to see protected regardless if the sub or Reddit exists or not, because in the years to come, I will never forget that at some point in my life, Donut incentively helped tapped the creative part of me that constantly seeks expression and validation. It made me feel alive.

**The Bad**

I may not be a good judge of character **—** and even risk coming off as self-righteous here **—**  but the truth has to be said that Donut also brought the worst in people (but has done far more good).

I have literally "survived" long enough in this space to see alliances form/break with strangers speaking ill about one another, and in worst cases wishing they could inflict bodily harm.

Maybe it's because the strongest drive known to humans isn't love or hate as Hollywood and other blue-pilled constructs would have us believe but purpose.

Nonetheless, it must be said that ambition or purpose should be matched with just the right amount of attitude. Nothing justifies being rude/uncharitable to people we don't know from Adam regardless if we share a common interest or not.

**My Vision For Donut**

**Fun Fact:** Donut is the first implementation of community points systems on Reddit. It survived the not-to-be-forgotten great sunset (thanks to the healthy distance it maintained from Reddit) and helped chart a prosperous future for other RCCs to follow (a model which r/CryptoCurrency adopted to continue Moons distribution). 

Being the OG that it is, my vision for Donut is to see it consistently edge towards becoming the perfect decentralized SocialFi project with each Donut initiative, governance proposal, improvement and developmental measures.

**Improvement (How To Make Donut Better)**

Projects are made for people, not people for projects. Commendably, the community around Donut now has good optics. The results of quality-content enforcement measures haven't gone unnoticed by many and the vibes are now good or far less toxic than they used to be. However, the most striking **—** probably the only **—** weakness of Donut is dwindling interest.

For this reason, I wholeheartedly welcome and support the [proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i8smzx/governance_poll_proposal_establish_the_donut_dao/) to Establish the Donut DAO org. The proposal is consistent with addressing Donut's exigent weakness by expanding and securing Donut's future beyond this sub (r/Ethtrader) and Reddit.

**Development (Creation Of Something New For Donut)**

Donut has never had a CEX listing. The importance of getting CEX-listed cannot be overemphasized. I strongly believe we will be amazed at how many problems a CEX listing would solve.

Understandably, measures like [smart contract audit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1hznng6/donut_initiative_unlocking_funds_for_smart/) (also something new) are being worked on in that regard (getting a CEX listing), and I am excited about it.

***God bless the founding fathers of Donut.***

***Big ups to the moderation team.***

***Best wishes to community members.***

***Long live Donut!!!***
