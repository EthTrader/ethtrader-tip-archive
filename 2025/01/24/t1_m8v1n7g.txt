Right, creating a proper text post on mobile can be frustrating. I tried once to make it, but it didn't compose the way I wanted, and then I discarded it without posting.

I hope you will figure it out! Using a laptop next time will probably make things easier. 

No worries! I hope more great stuff to read from you in the coming days.
