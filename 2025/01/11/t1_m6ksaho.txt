Technically we have to pay taxes on every cent, even donuts.

The problem is not when you get it, the problem is when you sell it and for how much.

For example, if I earn 100k donut and I dont pay taxes and suddently donut reach $1 and I sell for $100k when I cash out that would raise a lot of questions and probably a big fine proportional to the amount, meaning that I could lose the taxes 30% + a big extra fine.

From my point of view, better to be clean than getting fucked in the end but right now its a trust by both parties report. But they are increasing the checks.
