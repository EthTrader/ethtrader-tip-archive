Ive been saying. The early days are gone best thing to do is the Saylor move which is to DCA on a frequent basis as much as possible. Ive been doing it regardless of the price fluctuations for almost 5 years now and am in a lot of profit already. Sometimes I rotate between ETH BTC and LINK depending on whats lowest at the time but thats about it. Institutions being here is what keeps me investing in ETH to be honest - !tip 1
