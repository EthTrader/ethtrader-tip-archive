I still think we're still early.... ETH has a vast ecosystem we're yet to explore, the ENS dokain, the NFTs, layer2s and many more are yet to prevail and when the world started jumping into cryptocurrency, they'll join for either NFTs, DEFI and will surely use ETH layers. 

Eth still has lots of achievement to achieve, it's just that the bear makes lots of people leaves the crypto space already. When the bull arrives, the chart gonna be good once more
