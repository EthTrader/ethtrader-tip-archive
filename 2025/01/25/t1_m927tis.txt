I'm gonna say [NO] on this one.

I have seen some very generic comedy posts get removed; so; Moderation is still a part of it, as is the "recycled content" for images that are frequently posted.

Alternatively; instead of a cap per day per user, the Meme flair Image/Video could have a topic limiter cap, say, 13. The topic limiter goes by top 50, so 13 would be approximately 25% of posts.

However, given some of those flairs require being set by comment command; that would not work.
