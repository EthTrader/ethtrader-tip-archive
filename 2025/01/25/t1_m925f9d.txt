Memes are for special membership. I'm in for a cap put 1 meme post per 24hours seems a bit harsh to me. 3 meme per 24hoyrs seems okay enough but 1 is a bit harsh. 

BTW, we don't actually have enough users and not everyone post meme.
 This sub post more original text post as of recent even more than Link. Meme brings in engagement as well as text post and political post. We want more engagement right? I don't think 1meme per 24hours is actually fair. But that's my take though
