Thank you for bringing this to our attention. 

For clarification, all three funding sources will require the sale of DONUT? Or are the LP rewards in a different asset?

I am in support of doing the audit & availing the funds & hope it can be done with the least amount of DONUTs sold. In either case, I believe the benefits & increased legitimacy will ultimately be beneficial for the asset & it's price.
