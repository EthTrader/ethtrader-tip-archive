I appreciate the reply & totally get your argument against stagnation. Great analogy with EF.

It is admirable that the team want's to do this self-sustained & I have no doubt in their ability to do so.  However enganging the community on this might strengthen it at the same time & reaffirm peoples commitment to it. 

Once the decision to do that audit is final & fundraising begins, I believe it would be a good idea to inform the community about the fundraising. Share the treasury address in the post & say that all USDT/USDC donated until mm.dd.yy will be used towards the audit.

The more the community gets involved in the project, the closer their bond to it becomes.
