I don't think Pectra upgrade itself will have much direct impact on Ether's price - but, as the general market goes towards hype, and hype eventually fades - when profits from alt coins and other coins will eventually work their way back into BTC and ETH. 

Now, ETH isn't performing as well, and these other crypto which had suffered a lot have had some very successful short term gains in comparison to ETH.

Who know's what will happen or when it will happen - but the market goes through it's phases.

I think my ADA and FTM were both as much as -75% while my ETH was only -35% in 2022/2023.

Fast forward to 2025 and my ETH, ADA and FTM are +108%, +104% and +42%.

But, if you isolate them to just the last 6-12 months, ETH is my worst performer.
