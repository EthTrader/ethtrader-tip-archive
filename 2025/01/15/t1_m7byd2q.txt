possibly. however, it will be less overwhelming than links due to the fact that posts with that format are restricted to special membership subscribers. and if there is a greater influx of images or videos, it means there are more subscribers, which means more DONUT is being burned. so it wouldn't be terrible.

alternatively, if memes become an issue like links, we can implement a flair limit or a policy of one image / video post per day per user. just thinking out loud here.
