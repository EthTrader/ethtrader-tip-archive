Ty Marc and thanks Paul for the AMA


My question:

What are the biggest legal challenges that CEX face today, and how is Coinbase preparing for potential future regulatory shifts?


How do you see the role of the SEC and other financial regulators evolving in relation to new changes in SEC leadership , and what impact might that have on Coinbaseâ€™s future?

How can we get Donuts listed on Coinbase?
