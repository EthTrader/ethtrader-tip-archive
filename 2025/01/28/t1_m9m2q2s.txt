>it's a shame users sell below 20k - or even below 60k.

*I'm just giving my observation.*

Simple, probably they've more trust on other projects, so they take out money from here and invest in it.

Also, I think there are a few active users and all generous to tip without caring other user has 0 multiplier after selling or what. 

>self approve posts is a great perk.

Honestly, it was, but not as effective because many links are not allowed where you need to approve the post.
