I'd be curious to do a deep dive on the top 50 active users in the sub - and compare their Governance score to that of the Mod Team.

And then compare their CONTRIB to that of the mod team.

It's a shame we still have so many users selling below 20k DONUT, meaning their tips don't have full weight.
