>Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw $3.3 billion in weekly inflows, pushing year-to-date inflows to a record $10.8 billion, according to CoinShares. Bitcoin led with $2.9 billion in inflows, while Ether ETPs gained $326 million. Total assets under management in crypto ETPs briefly hit an all-time high of $187.5 billion. XRP ETPs, however, experienced record outflows of $37.2 million. 

We are just getting started. I reckon the inflows will more than 100x when the bull season sets in later in Q4.
