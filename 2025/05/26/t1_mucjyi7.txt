Marketcap predictions are always tricky!

DONUT has peaked a little over 8 million marketcap last bull run, but between an inflationary nature and constant sell pressure, it bottomed out all the way at 300k earlier this year.

Growth and development is ongoing and there are now multiple means of burning DONUT with products/services like the Special Membership for the sub.

Just to throw a clean number out there, I'd say hitting 5 Million in marketcap this year is quite attainable as sell pressure decreases.

Welcome to EthTrader, I see you have your stash ready for the ride!
