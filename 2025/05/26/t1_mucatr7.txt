From a personal standpoint, I hope that the proposal not only reduced some of the sell pressure, but also encourages some additional buy pressure... which in turn will actually help trading opportunities. 

Improving on-chain metrics will also help DONUT gain more exposure and be a viable option for partners/advertisers/sponsors to deal with, maybe an exchange listing, and additional growth forward.

I have also been in the process of drafting a proposal to provide additional perks for users with high levels of governance, as a way to recognize those that have continued to show support for the eco-system - but, it still needs more work xD

The future is bright!
