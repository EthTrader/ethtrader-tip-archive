Honestly, I feel like I'll rather go with u/Aminok ideas of having ETH for donut multiplier honestly. Those are better as this sub is about ETH and donut rewards are just for participating in the sub.

 I understand Airlines proposal though(as his work was to market donut), but giving penalty to past users who sell is just wrong. Honestly I feel like Aminok ideas is just better to end all these drama going on in this sub. 

And love your proposal, [YES] from me
