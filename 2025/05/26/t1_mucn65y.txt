BTC maxi's are doing pretty well for themselves... 

I think SOL is just going through a phase and will fade off again - I remain quite optimistic on Ethereum's future, and definitely letting stake rewards build up over time. But, it's a fools errand to not include BTC in a portfolio xD

Hopefully the future is bright!
