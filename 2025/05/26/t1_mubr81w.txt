Not biased and I am not even getting affected by the other proposal.

In any case this proposal would force the other one to adjust it to work from the day it is approved forward and not retroactively while also making the DAO rules more predictable, etc.

Anyway totally respecting your opinion but we should try not to mix things. Both works toward totally different aspects.
