> Arbitrum Can Do Everything Base Can, But Not Vice Versa

Dems fighting words! xD

Base definitely gains some exposure from it's connection with Coinbase exchange, but I must admit, I haven't exactly deep dived into the network, however I have used it, and it doesn't very different at all.

Sometimes projects choosing one network or another simply comes down to whatever grants or donations they may have received from Networks.
