[YES] It is surprising how this was not in effect already. If people want to sell their DONUTs then they are free to do so but there should be consequences and this should not be a full-time job. It would be better if it was not retroactive however, so if possible this would only be in effect after the poll passed, that is the only adjustment I would make otherwise big yes.
