Funnily enough, the longest comment chains that occur on this sub, are the ones between non-registered users - I would say many people still look to comment to the "regulars" - or may respond to, but don't tip unregistered users, or users that didn't tip them in the first place. 

That was main purposes behind the raffle, to encourage the people who make 100+ tips a round to tip beyond the same circle of 20 users - as a way to organically help the DONUT eco-system grow.
