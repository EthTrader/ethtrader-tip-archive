Ok we create about 100 or 1000 Reddit collectable avatars for each of these levels and 1M and 2M. You can only claim them when you hold the amount of dounts required for that level and you can only select one for each level you reached. Obviously they would need to be unique per level and avatar. Would be nice if you could identify from which level the avatar is by just looking at it. Random internet fame points and status gets most of the people going :D
