I remember holding over 200k MOON when it was ranging about 30c.... that was fun. Until I woke up to the sunset xD

I prefer my own custody of crypto, so I won't really bother with ETF's personally, but to complement crypto, I hedge my bets with the "safety" of investing in gold.

Always good to diversify, but also important not to over-diversify.
