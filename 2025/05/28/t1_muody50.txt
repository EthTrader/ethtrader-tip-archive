No kidding - failing to reach an ATH in the first peak of this bull run, any analysis that suggests ETH could over double the 2021 ATH price, with a greater circulating supply, is insane

And yes, if I see 5k, I'll probably cash most of it out, and just leave a couple of ETH staking and to play with to satisfy my degen needs. xD
