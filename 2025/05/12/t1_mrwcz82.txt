It's my first appearance on the donut leaderboard. Happy to be one of those new folks sharing the donut love! 


Kind of a noob question...I think I just missed the last donut distribution. So the donuts that I'm sending now will come out of any distribution I'll get in the future? Or if I send more than I receive right now will I just sit at 0 until I receive more than I send? 


Thanks putting together this data for the community, DrRobbe!
