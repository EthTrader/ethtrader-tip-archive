Aw kirt im sorry to hear that to you man… no one deserves to have it happen to them…it was a gut wrenching feeling and im happy it wasn’t much $ in the end. im taking it as a huge learning lesson and a way to get better at earning and studying how this shit works and what syncing is and all this..

I didn’t realize my contrib would be gone too but is it since I made a new wallet and registered it?Also I appreciate your kindness… 🙏
