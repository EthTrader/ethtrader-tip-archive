It's a raffle, so theres only one winner anyway - but I'll exclude myself from the raffle draw in any case as I'm drawing it myself. If it was somehow selected by random nature on the blockchain sure I might include my chance - but, by goal isn't for me to earn more DONUT, but I'd rather see more participation from the rest of the community.
