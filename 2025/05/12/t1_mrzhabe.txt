Just a heads up, you can send donut tips even before your counter shows that you have any. Essentially, each month donuts are distributed to active members along with any tips that weren't sent by others. The tips that you send now will just come from that allotment.


So comment, add to the community, send donut tips, and in a month or so your flair will update with a batch of sugary goodness! 


I just registered a wallet this weekend so I also missed the recent monthly distribution. What donuts showing up in my flair now are ones I bought on sushi swap today.
