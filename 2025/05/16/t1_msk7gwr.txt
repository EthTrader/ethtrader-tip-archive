Appreciate you sharing your experience — it’s clear you’ve been through real cycles. But I’m not chasing hype coins or trusting my money to CeFi platforms promising fantasy returns. I’m putting in the time to actually understand the space — following ETH development, watching upgrades like Pectra, rollups, Danksharding — not just headlines.

I get that most people still don’t grasp Web3. That’s exactly why I’m learning now — by the time they do, it’s already priced in. I’m not pretending I have it all figured out, and I’m fine being wrong. But what I’m not fine with is sitting back, ignoring my own conviction, and later regretting I never moved when I believed the most.

I’m not here to gamble. I’m here to build insight, take calculated risks, and play the long game. ETH is where I’ve chosen to start. Time will tell if I was early, or just right.

I’d rather be early and wrong than late and bitter. At least I moved when it mattered. !tip 10
