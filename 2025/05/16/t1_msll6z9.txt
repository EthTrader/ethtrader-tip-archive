I really liked how they managed it. Now there is $20 Million bounty on those bad actors information to get them behind bars but this happens with everything. This is the classic way of getting a SIM swapped.

Anyway, not your keys, not your coins.

The good thing is that you need to have a high position in the company to have access to real sensitive data like seed phrases, etc. and you know how this is, higher you are, less people and more salary so bribing them is harder. However, bribing someone that gets a shitty salary in a customer support company that is probably in India, well. Easy to bribe.
