As far as I know a new contract will be deployed to fix some stuff that was detected in the official audit.

Also there will be a new website to centralize all the DONUT DAO information in a better way, etc.

A Twitter account was created [https://x.com/TheDonutDAO](https://x.com/TheDonutDAO) and things are about to get hot soon.

All this info has been taken from comments and posts here and there from the mod team.
