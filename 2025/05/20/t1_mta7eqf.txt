>DCinvestor's tweet should be a wake-up call. In a year we are going to look back and realize this was the turning point. Mark my words, ETH investors are going to be the ones saying, 'I told you so' while the doubters struggle to catch up. Ethereum has the best fundamentals in crypto and the price will follow. This is just the beginning.

Dude are you Vitalik in disguise??? Your post are always bullish on ETH, LOVE IT
