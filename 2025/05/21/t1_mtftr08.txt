>Meanwhile, [CryptoRank.io](http://CryptoRank.io) [revealed](https://x.com/cryptorank_io/status/1923875599275143300?) that more than 1 million ETH exited exchanges in the last month alone. This trend suggests that users are leaning toward holding ETH long-term rather than trading it. On-chain data confirms this behavior as it shows whales – wallets with over 10,000 ETH – have accumulated 450,000 coins since late April. By May 10, they collectively held 40.75 million ETH, the highest level since March.

If all these continued, ETH gonna hit a trillion mcap sooner
