Yea but wall street heads aren't long term thinkers. And if they're only thinking of gains then they'll make aETHrETH an ETF and get that extra 0.01% APY lol

Imagine if warren buffet scooped up that ETF though, that would be massively bullish.

Historically they scoop up a bunch and sell before hitting the projected ATH, possibly to cover losses on their shitty stocks. Still quite bullish, just keep hodling, wall street street will poison itself. But it's going to be a long battle.
