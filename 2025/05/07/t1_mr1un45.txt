For my fellow lazy readers:

* This will boost staking flexibility - it will raise validator limits from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH
* Enhances Layer 2 scalability with EIP-7691s blob throughput increase. EIP-7702 also simplifies wallets via account abstraction
* Its a big step for usability and efficiency

I think its gonna be great for ETHs adoption - !tip 1
