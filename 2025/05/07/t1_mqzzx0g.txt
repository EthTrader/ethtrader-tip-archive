The gaming industry is one of interest for a lot of people, but unfortunately, it's just easier and probably cheaper, especially for things like microtransactions, just to be handled internally/centralized, rather than blockchain based.

I'd love the idea of skins/decals for many games to be NFT's, but if you could resell more easily, there would be less revenue going to companies like Blizzard, Valve (DOTA2) etc.

Hell, I'd love for cars/decals to be transferrable across Need for Speed games! xD
