>Comparing Ethereum to traditional stores of value: Gold ($22T), M2 Money Supply ($100T), Real Estate ($700T), Stocks ($100T), and Bonds ($140T) - if ETH captures just 1% of these assets its market cap could reach $10T

It's always good to imagine WHAT IF. I wonder what donut price wil be if that happen as donut is kinda tied with how ETH performs  :)
