>Shiba Inu (SHIB) could be poised for a price rally due to three key factors: a 300% surge in token burning, increasing activity on Shibarium, and recent exchange outflows indicating a shift to self-custody

I don't think the burn token has anything to do with the price at this point. The burn token hasn't add much tbh but I still believe the layer2 shibarium will definitely help with the price
