>Â I see a lot of people here and on Twitter saying Ethereum is a scam and a dead blockchain

Calling ETH dead is actually disrespectful

Prices have the community mad and I get it because losing money sucks

What I learned in the space is, the hype token isn't for a long term, the one with development is actuallly here to stay. ETH might not be doing pretty well right now but the development in the ecosystem shows it's for long term and its here to stay.
