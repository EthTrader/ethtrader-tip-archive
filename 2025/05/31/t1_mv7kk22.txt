Congrats on going wholecoiner OP!! Ethereum has the best tech in crypto, sure it has a different value than BTC as BTC is scarce and ETH has an unlimited supply which may cap price growth. But Ethereum's adoption could lift the price to like $5,000-$7,000 easily, keep in mind BTC dominance is slowly fading away. In the end the best thing to do is to diversify.
