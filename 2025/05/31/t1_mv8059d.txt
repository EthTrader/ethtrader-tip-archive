Agree. Whether it's something Reddito could do as a website data call, (like ccmoons used to have) or whether it's a donut-bot command prompt.

And yes, will ask a few questions in the new post when it's up and running xD

But, there will likely be scripts used to exclude liquidity positions and other contracts like purchasing memberships - and hopefully in future, more services that can be paid for with DONUT can be attained.

The future is sprinkled!
