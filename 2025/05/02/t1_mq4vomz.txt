>If youre bullish on Ethereums ecosystem - its apps - rollups - and onchain GDP - ETH acts as the "index" to capture its growth. Similar to how a diversified US asset basket in 1947 grew from $1000 to $3/4 million by 2025 through compounding

So if we're patient enough, ETH might make us a millionaire???
