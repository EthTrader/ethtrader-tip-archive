I suspect Coingecko is only counting the circulating supply on the Arbitrum One network. (4.1 M moons) - but there should be a total of 78.8M moons between Arbitrum One and Nova. I believe Kraken hold about 6 Million on Arb Nova alone.

78.8M supply at 7c would put moons about 5.5M market cap and ranked between 1800-1900.
