I'm confident it will be deployed by June, at least a beta version.

There's always more stuff I want to add, but if I keep waiting for it to be “complete” it will never launch. So I'll probably release an initial version and upgrade it over time.

Right now, I'm working on the blog. After that it's just the whitepaper and a few final touches.
