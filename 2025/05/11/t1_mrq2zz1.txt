>This is pretty wild and its a bit like watching a race with 70 runners but only 3 of them are actually near the finish line. While its impressive to see Arbitrum, Base and Optimism

Why'd I feel like ZKsync and Starknet is more popular than OPTIMISM but OP is doing pretty well than em. Just like how BNB is doing pretty well than Solana but Sol is more hyped
