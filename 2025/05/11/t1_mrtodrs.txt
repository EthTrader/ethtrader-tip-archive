>Ultra sound money is an Ethereum meme that focuses on the likely decrease of the ETH supply. It refers to the concept that if capped-supply gold is considered sound, then decreasing-supply ether is considered ultra sound. The ETH supply decreases whenever more ETH is destroyed via fee burn than ETH is created via issuance
