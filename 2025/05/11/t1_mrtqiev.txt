Used lightening once, it's faster and cheaper and I never have the thought of how better tthe lightening is in comparison to ETH L2s or criticize Eth l2s in any ways.

I'm the type of guy that loves cheaper and faster transactions.

 I guess the ones saying ETH L@s are bad have no idea how ETH works. They're just pained ETH is doing well and it might be BITCOIN biggest competitor
