If I am not wrong Matt use to accumulate all the distros in the cycle and then do a multisig with that but I can be wrong.

First check your country legal rules regarding being a multisig member. Some countries like Spain requires to notify each member of the multisig to the authorities and even pay taxes on it. Shitty rule. Then contact mod team.
