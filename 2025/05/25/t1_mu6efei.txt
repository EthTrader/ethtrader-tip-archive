I believe the retroactive part is a mistake for several reasons.

1. You cant punish people for acting in the past when there were no rules regarding this. Example, I live in a shitty country and I instanly convert my job earned fiat to a better currency and its okay doing it. 1 year later my gov decides that now people that did it will earn half of the fiatnam paycheck. It makes no sense.

2. Doing it not retrospective could give a second chance in a more fair way.
