[NO]

Sorry Kirt, I see where you are coming from but Trust me your proposal is an exercise in futility and you are clearly outnumbered here. Personally my multiplier would be around 0.1 - 0.3   but fuck it, let's look at the bright side which I outlined on the proposal that inspired yours.

>I believe it will stimulate the donut economy like more stakeholders buying back their multiplier before snapshot, thereby preventing embarrassing dumps and giving us the traction (transaction counts) we need for CEX listing and to be taken seriously by other investors who will hold for the long term. The meta will be no more extractive but progressive. Genius! ðŸ«¡
