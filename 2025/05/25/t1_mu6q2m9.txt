>New rules shouldnt be retroactive

Valid point! The new rules should only take effect from the time they're implemented rather than being penalized for the actions taken before those rules not existed.

Another thing if it implemented from the start all were try to buy to make their multiplier 1, which will eventually rise the üç© price.
