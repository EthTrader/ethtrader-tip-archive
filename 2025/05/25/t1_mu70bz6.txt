This is my main point of view and rules should be objective and never reward/punish people on how people understand an specific action that happened in the past.

For example, people that sold will defend that they weren't doing anything wrong and technically speaking taking in count the rules back then they were not doing anything wrong. On the other hand, other people will believe that selling as soon as getting the distro was wrong but this belief fall under a moral point of view that is subjective and not objective and falls under each individual believes.
