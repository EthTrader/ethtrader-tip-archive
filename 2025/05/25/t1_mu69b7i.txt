[NO]

First it will be hard to calculate, eg look at my flair it looks like I sold a lot, but I just earned much more contrib than donuts for post of the week etc..

Second I think to decentration it also belongs free will over your money, and I don't like rules which penalizing this. 
I would rather come up with a rewarding benefit for holding, like Avatars or special flairs etc instead of penalizing people
