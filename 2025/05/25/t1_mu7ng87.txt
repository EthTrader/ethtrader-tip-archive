[Yes]

This proposal is well conceived. I believe it will stimulate the donut economy like more stakeholders buying back their multiplier before snapshot, thereby preventing embarrassing dumps and giving us the traction (transaction counts) we need for CEX listing and to be taken seriously by other investors who will hold for the long term. The meta will be no more extractive but progressive. Genius! ðŸ«¡

I have a question tho, please will it be applied for this current round 149 distro or for the next (round 150 distro)?
