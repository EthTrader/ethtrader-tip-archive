Ah nostalgia from the moons selling penalty.

Where the cruel irony is that those that have sold have no weight to vote against this... xD

Due to recent price action, my governance weight is shot as well given my share in the Liquidity Pool.

Having observed this rule in effect in r/cc, this implementation would most definitely see an increase in alt accounts and penalty evasion, adding more workload for the mods.
