I understand that, having clear penalties is necessary and they were necessary back then. I even think that I have 1x multiplier (didn't run calculations) but I truly believe that retroactive rules are not a good idea.

Maybe we can have them but could make sense that retroactive rule proposals to be forced to have a higher % consensus to pass.
