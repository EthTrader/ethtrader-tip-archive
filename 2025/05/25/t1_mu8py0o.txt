>Imagine what will happen when DONUT reaches something like $0.03. At that price, top farmers earning 42.5K Donuts per round would be pulling in around $1,275 per month.

>That creates a strong, recurring incentive to sell, which means predictable, monthly sell pressure on the token.

>Multiply that by the number of active farmers and you end up with a cyclical wave of value extraction, which is super unattractive to potential partners or CEXs evaluating the health and sustainability of DONUT. Even worse, they might interpret it as manipulation and just decide not to list or support DONUT at all.

Honestly, I feel like if you could put this on the proposal, you wouldn't have some people going against it. I've sold donut as well and I understand your point now that selling huge amount of donut every distro will look as if folks are dumping and CEX listing might not be possible. 

I agree with everything you said, but making a proposal about new rules to affect people that sold in the past just doesn't sound right. The proposal will affect folks that are here and sold in the past but not newbies. 

Every new proposal supposed to affect every folks in this subreddit, not just affecting folks that have been here in the past. If this proposal will only start from the current rounds it pass, I won't mind voting for it honestly, even if the percentage reduces to selling more than 10% from 25%.

But making a proposal to affect people that sold in the past(even when selling in the past isn't really against the rule) I don't think it's fair honestly. That's just my opinion though
