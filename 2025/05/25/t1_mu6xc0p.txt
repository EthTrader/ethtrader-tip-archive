Yes, totally valid concerns that I didn't take in count at the time of writing. Totally forgot about the rewards part so I think that allowing retroactive rewards makes sense. ^(Updated it)

While I agree that people can always vote "No" on a proposal with retroactive elements, this is about setting a **clear and predictable foundation.** That **rules apply from now on, not backwards**. It helps proposal authors too, they will know in advance that retroactive punishments or eligibility changes are off limits, so they can design better proposals.

This isn't about limiting flexibility. It's about defining fair play. You can reward the past but we shouldn't rewrite it.
