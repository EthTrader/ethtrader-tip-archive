I still disagree because those people that in the past sold for whatever reason acted under certain rules and now this governance will punish people for past actions of a time when doing it wasnt punished at all.

If we apply that to other financial incentive of any kind of platform that could be any other system that gives payments like a regular job. Would it make sense to punish citizens that converted in the past their country currency to another better currency now with this rule? No sense to me to be retroactive.
