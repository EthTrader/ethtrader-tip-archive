[NO] 
I like the idea to weight donut distribution more heavily to those that will hold most of their donut but applying a new rule to past actions feels inherently unfair to me. If there was a way to set the mechanic in place going forward (even if that means starting in the current round), I would support that change as that gives users a chance to make an informed decision on whether they want to sell their distributed donuts or not.
