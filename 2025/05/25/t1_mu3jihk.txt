Sadly, theres still less than 50k liquidity available of Sushi.com - incentives have recently increased for LPers, but we still need to build it up.

That said, I would have though buying DONUT wouldn't have seen that much slippage given it's reccent price increases, it's back at a DONUT/ETH ratio that it used to be at.
