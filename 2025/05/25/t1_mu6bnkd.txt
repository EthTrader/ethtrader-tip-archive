THIS..... The rules before was no penalty for people who sold donut right? But now, they're implementing rules for people who sold their donut, shouldn't it be calculated as in every donut you earn in every distro, if you sell more than 25% you'll be penalized (that's what happened in RCC if I'm correct)

The rule is like AMERICAN BRINGING UP NEW RULES TO BAN LICENCES TO GUNS and STARTED JAILING PEOPLE THAT OWNS GUN LICENSED IN THE PAST
