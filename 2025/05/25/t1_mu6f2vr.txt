Currently I think this will hit most of the most active users again, which do create content, we have about 25 to 35 actually active users, if we do this the sub will be even more empty. I fear for No posts no comments other than from  DRBiMatt basically. Maybe Reddito can check how many from the top 10 would have 0.1 multipler.
