$1 DONUT would be nice

Unless of course, DONUT is $1 because ETH is 15k, and it costs $20 for a loaf of bread... xD

The world is pretty chaotic afterall

>Also, it is a painful thing tho that you have to write a post of minimum 200 words to be able to submit it to this subreddit but yea bearable. It's a tiny problem cuz not all posts are a post worthy of like 200 words yk. Just like this one, it's a casual question just out of curiosity. 

For future reference, this is exactly what the pinned Daily Discussion is for.
