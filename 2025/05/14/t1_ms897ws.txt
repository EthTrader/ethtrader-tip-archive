It wont, there is a limit of 3 buys per avatar for each reddit user xD

The best you can do is
1- create the avatar
2-let them buy it.

However talking with Reddit I am sure you can make free releases but it requires talking to them, etc. Jarrito event did that but it was with the previous administration
