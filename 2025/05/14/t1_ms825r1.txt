The problem with this is Reddit itself. I know that with the previous admin they could allow to create RCAs related to crypto if the one submitting the art was the owner of the project itself. However admins changed and now communication is opaque and I believe they dont allow it now.

Also to make the 100k, 250k, etc claimable stuff you need code and Reddit well, better not talk about that topic xD

But I love your idea, I have thought so many times about it but yeah, too many problems to be able to create stuff. You can always create avatars not related to crypto at all but to the sub without breaking the crypto rule but again, the claimable part is hard to convince Reddit.
