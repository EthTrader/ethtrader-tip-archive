Great idea to reward those who keep stacking and holding. However, it might not be enough to fully discourage those who sell off after each distribution round.

I think we should consider implementing a rule where selling activity reduces a user's multiplier.
Currently, it is easy to maintain 20k DONUT and rest you can sell.

What are your thoughts on that❓️
