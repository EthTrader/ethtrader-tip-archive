>Ethereum does not need flashy CNBC shills or fake hype to win. It has something a lot more real: organic belief. Nick pointed out how Ethereum's strength comes from a community that is all in on a vision bigger than just making quick money. That is very rare in crypto these days.

If the tech keeps improving, adoption keeps occurring, eventually it will market itself simply by those who are using it, not because of those who are advertising it.
