Good analysis, thanks for sharing! 


If you're into Matt Furie memecoins, Strawberry in Bloom (BERRY) just launched a few days ago. It's being touted as the ladyPepe and I think will be featured in his soon-to-be-released book. It's around $.008-$0.012 now but may be worth grabbing in case it takes off.
