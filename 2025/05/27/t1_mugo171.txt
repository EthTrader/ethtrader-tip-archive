> believe with ethereum beginning to outperform bitcoin during the last run up we are going to start to see the general altcoin market outperform bitcoin going forward

Heres hoping. I started to focus more in on ETH again when it found new lows in the ETH/BTC ratio - and at this point got a handful of alts that I may as well just hold to see if they can go through a period of strong performance.
