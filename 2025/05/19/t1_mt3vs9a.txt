I would say while It's a great network in it's own right - it is slightly faster and even cheaper than Arbitrum One, it doesn't really matter because Arbitrum One is fast and cheap enough the difference is negligible. Unfortunately, Arb Nova simply lacks liquidity, support and interest. 

Moons might be the biggest project on Arb Nova, and that's unfortunately saying something. Nothing wrong with it, but without the interest from larger projects and support from other platforms, it's probably not going to grow much.
