I feel that that giving everybody entries for tipping the same 20-25 people does not actually increase growth of EthTrader, nor does it actually incentivize tipping beyond the same core group. As it stands, you tip the same 20-25 people, you have 0 chance of winning, hence a floor of 50, to help diversify the receivers and encourage discussion with new users.

There are hundreds of different users that actually comment in the sub each day - but most people only interact with those who will tip them back.

I may deprecate this community event at some stage in lieu of other community events.
