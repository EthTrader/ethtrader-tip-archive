Yeah, I know. We all are brokies here xD

Same, I switched to drawing to find something I really liked doing and I do it as a hobby, not huge money but still helps and I love what I do so enjoying it a lot.

Also stress here has been reduced a lot since finally we achieved to pass a cap on the DONUT you can earn every cycle 45k (I think) so no more race. More healthy environment to be honest. Miss you all guys.

A few days ago I made 1 year as avatar artist so thats great, time flies.
