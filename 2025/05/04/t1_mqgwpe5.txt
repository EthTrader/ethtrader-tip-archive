There comes a point when you can over-diversify too.... I know I made that mistake 4-5 years ago.

It's easy to say in hindsight that you should have "just gone all in on BTC" or boughht SOL at the bottom etc. But that's just saying you wish you could time the market.

Personally, I still look at BTC / ETH as the two core assets to have in a portfolio. I've taken a hedge with ADA as the one competing alt that might surprise us long term, but other than that, I look at other tokens within the Ethereum eco-system for more short term gains.
