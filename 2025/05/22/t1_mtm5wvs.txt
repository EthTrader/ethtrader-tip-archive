>Scammers obtained user information through social engineering and attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase, which refused to pay.

I love that CB refused to pay. There's no guarantee that the scammers won't do whatever they wished with the data even after settlement. Terrorists are not to be negotiated with. It's sad tho that 70k users now have their private information in wrong hands.
