And I heard it is DONUT shaped. Losing faith on MOONs, too many market manipulators, non existing roadmap or some short we are planning to do this since a year ago... Not looking good.

However, DONUT has a lot of developments already and more are coming and communication is done in a monthly basis which is enough taking in count the man force to develop stuff, etc. 

Bullish on DONUT
