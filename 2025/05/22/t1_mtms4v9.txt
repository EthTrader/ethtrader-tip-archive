I remain bullish on both.

I think one of the problems with moons however is the fact some of the team members are involved in some of the other community points.

As it is, most of devs and mods of r/cc and r/ethtrader are not full time working on the token, so some of the long durations it takes to get stuff done, I can forgive - it's not like the Ethereum Foundation or the Arbitrum Foundation where theres full time or staff running the show.

Atleast the DONUT DAO team members are focussed on DONUT, whereas some of the r/cc members are involved in coneheads and some of the others.
