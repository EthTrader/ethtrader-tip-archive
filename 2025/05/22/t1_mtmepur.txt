I remember MOONs, I earned a few (something around 600 or 700 I cannot remember) before the Reddit sunset. After that I am afraid it died. Reddit controlled and was doing everything behind the scenes so without Reddit they cannot do anything with the token I think. I even stopped checking the subreddit. Here though we have a great team and I trust them fully.
