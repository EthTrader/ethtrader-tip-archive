Completely agree with that, even a once a month general update should be a bare minimum, with a little followup to answer some Q's that can be easily answered.

Even just a paragraph in the snapshot postings just to say, we are aware of X, Y and Z, we can't give a definitive answer but we are working on resolving X then Y then Z.

Communications is key!
