Yes, I understand that but I dont understand dont giving active feedback or some sort of we are working on X stuff.

Also another thing that raises a red flag is that usually the community currency bot to withdraw earned MOONs is without funds so we currently have paper Moons there and no one can withdraw. I sent a modmail a few days ago and also radio silence.

Radio silence is the worst way to handle things. In this case DONUT is ages away with all the automatic steps and well settled process to distribute, etc.

I hate radio silences and I imagine that investors would hate that too.
