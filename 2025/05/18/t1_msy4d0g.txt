I think that's absolutely where Eth is going but we can't ignore the larger cycle. I don't see us hitting 5k before the end of this cycle and we have to endure the bear market reset for a year or more before hitting the portion of the cycle where 8-12k is reachable. Certainly worth holding on to for some folks.Â
