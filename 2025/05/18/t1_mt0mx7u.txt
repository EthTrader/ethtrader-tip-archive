I feel like this is part of the cooling off from recent jumps up. Btc and Eth had reached oversold levels and needed some time going level or down a bit to reset RSI levels. Don't take financial advice from randos on the internet but my guess is that we continue the sideways cool off and then jump wildly at the next bit of good news (I'm guessing tariff news but could be anything). I'm expecting that jump this week, likely midweek.
