A quick summary 

Reddit Community Points are points given out by subreddits for various things, primarily for activity in their sub. For your contributions to this sub, you will receive the Cryptocurrency token $DONUT every 28 days after a calculation of total activity and your contribution. You will also earn these Donuts from competitions, contests, from people tipping you etc. you could also buy some(and sell too)!

Please go through the wiki at the beginning of the subreddit to get all info. I think the command to get started is !register <your-wallet-addr>
