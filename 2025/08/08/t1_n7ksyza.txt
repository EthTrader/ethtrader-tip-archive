On the flipside, the longer you are away from retirement, the more risk tolerance you may want to have.

I'd be quite happy to be in my 30's and 40's and have a portion dedicated into a higher risk portfolio and then rebalance into lower risk, lower reward assets closer to retirement.

That said, no way would I be "all in" either, and I'd still want ongoing contributions split accordingly.
