I like the More ETH option as well. But if you want to have a little extra boost you could look at staking for additional asset growth.

If you are not confident in DeFi, I would recommend holding your ETH and Staking on Coinbase.

If you are comfortable with DeFi, I would suggest Everstake.One for staking, or even app.aave.com for lending.

In the meantime, Welcome to EthTrader, feel free to register your Ethereum address for our subs SocialFi token, $DONUT
