Probably you are right. I also think the same POL price is under pressure due to the rise of newer L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. These networks have captured the spotlight with strong institutional backing and growing traction from both users and developers. Base, in particular, benefits from Coinbase ecosystem support, drawing significant attention and liquidity - some of which might have otherwise flowed into Polygon.
