I learned my lesson not to hold assets I don't really believe in all that much. 
Sol might not be a shitcoin but it's fundamentals are just not really comparable to eth's sadly. 

I will probably hold my sol through the cycle simply because it's not much anyway, but I should never have bought it to begin with because I never really thought it would really compete with eth and therefore it only makes sense that it's price patterns are also almost exclusively retail driven and do not make a lot of sense which I learned that I don't really like to see in my bag. It's the same reason I don't like BTC all that much, speculative assets are just terrible to hold imo, even if they appreciate of the long term, predictability just is a great thing to have long term. And that is probably also why institutions also like eth so much lately. It just the King of security and reliability and has probably some of the most solid tokenomics out there.
