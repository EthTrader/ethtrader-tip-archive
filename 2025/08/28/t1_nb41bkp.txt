This all makes a lot of sense, I always try to diversify my tips and tip everyone equally even if they are not registered. I think the best way to bring new users is to tip them, if they are curious they will try to learn about DONUTs and register. I also avoid tipping bad posts, even terrible memes, and I try not to tip the same people over and over again but since there are not that many of us it is hard to diversify.. but I try!!
