It'll take a community effort to change the overall tipping culture, but with posts like DrRobbe's, some of these patterns are highlighted. 

This of course, doesn't mean tip all the unregistered users everything either, as many of their comments are also low effort, but as you said, tipping content that positively contributes to a higher quality sub is the direction we are striving to achieve. 

Thank you for helping shape EthTrader into the community we want it to be in order to grow, where quality contributions are rewarded fairly and where advertisers see value in running campaigns here.
