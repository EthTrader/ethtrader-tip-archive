But, how many of the top 20 users engage with unregistered users, or the casual registered users? Not that many.

This is why we try to avoid the "reciprocal tipping" of low effort comments; as it creates a negative feedback loop where the distribution is highly concentrated amongst the "top 20" and casual members are ignored, or feel ignored - counter-intuitive to growing a community.
