I have the glorious golden donut, which is a perk of being a "special member" or subscriber (A seasonal NFT for EthTrader Membership). One of these perks is it gives me the option to set my own user flair.

Other perks include being able to comment gifs and publish image posts to the sub.

There's a lot of creative innovation the DONUT DAO has come up with bringing this SocialFi token and Web3 together.
