You get not only the tipped amount but also a fixed ratio per tip at every distribution end. Which is where most donuts come from. 

Other than tipping I also provide liquidity to the donut eth pool on sushi. You get also more donuts rewards from that and help the community, if you are looking for a usecase. Moreover you could buy special membership which burns donuts and gives you an ntf and special perks in this sub. 

Welcome
