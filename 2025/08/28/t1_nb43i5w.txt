On one hand, I'm surprised steam haven't already lead the way of this type of adoption.

But, on the other hand, I guess re-selling games means less revenue, as otherwise people are forced to buy their own copy at full price. Like Reddit NFT's, there can always be the "original owner gets a token % of the re-sale value".
