To add;

When you award someone a tip, the tip itself is deducted from your next round Distribution, and the tip is used to calculcate the rewards that comme from the DONUT DAO treasury.

These tips are all calculated off-chain, and settled approx once a month before being distributed on-chain.

If your tips send exceed the DONUT you receive, those tips simply won't be factored.
