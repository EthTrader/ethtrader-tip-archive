> ETH still has not reclaimed its ATH of $4.8k. When it does there is no resistance left, so that is when price discovery starts happening and $6,500/$7,000 becomes the next stop.

Love this. Plus an actual realistic price target for the near future xD

ETH season is here, and I expect we can see ETH dominance rise to atleast 16% again. Currently about 12.8%, follolwing it's lows of 8-9% a few months ago.
