Understandable. I had a feeling there would be a tug of war between bulls and profit takers around this sort of range. It might take a few attempts to actually break out and reach a new ATH.

Some users have been holding onto their investment for years waiting for some profits, others are more ambitious and will wait for even higher prices. 

I will continue to hold and stake most of my ETH, letting my passive rewards eventuate into stable income!
