Congrats on your win.

To add to the other comment.

These tips are all recorded "off-chain" and then settled about once a month, with the inclusion of DONUT emissions directly from the DONUT DAO.

This is why you need to register your Ethereum address by following the command prompts for Donut-Bot to record in order to receive your reward.

It's essentially tokenized karma, in the form of a SocialFi token used for rewards as well as governance.

Yes, it's a bit complex at first, but it's also innovation and one of EthTraders projects into cryptocurrency adoption.
