I love watching people get nervous about market normal moves. Its like they forget the past. And they say, why if this is the top? That's when you have to check economy and see if big boys made money and its status. Selling before cutting rates and watching big boys shill their stuff looks wrong, too early. Unless you are a trader that you sell tops and buy lows during the whole process.
