I look forward to an automatic implementation whenever and if possible!

For reference, there are currently 6 Meme flaired posts on the Hot/Front page.

I'll vote [YES] but I am highly in favour of an automatic implementation as soon as possible; not just from a work-load factor but to help save some Pay2Post fees. Although, this can still be avoided with simple awareness of the front page before posting anything.
