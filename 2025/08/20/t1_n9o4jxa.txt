I changed my strategy at the beginning of the year so I can buy a flat (currently deciding which one make an offer on) without the need of selling crypto at all. Now I can really patiently wait even for another cycle if it is needed.

Next goal, paying the whole loan and probably start collecting more money for my retirement house in the mountains.
