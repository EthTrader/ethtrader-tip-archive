Maxi mentality is always interesting.

Whether it be BTC Maxi, ETH maxi or even those extremists in r/buttcoin 

But when people spend more of their energy being negative towards something rather than being positive to something else, is usually more of a reflection of them rather than the project/system they're hating on xD
