I miss him mtoo, and I miss that content. Made a few guides myself as well back when it was "peak airdrop" season.

That's right, you did pretty well with Berachain!

I very easily got 4 digits worth out of BLAST, L3, ZKSync and a few others that I can't recall off the top of my head.

A shame most of those airdrop guides were largely under-appreciated and ignored!
