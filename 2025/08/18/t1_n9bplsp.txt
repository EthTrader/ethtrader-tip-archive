Yeh, I don't see myself buying KAT, but I'll gladly receive some for trying their network, staking ETH and providing liquidity!

I'm more interested in seeing how the network itself compares numbers wise after the airdrop then the token price.

Will it be an Arbitrum or Polygon (poor token price, highly utilized networks), or will it be a Scroll or Blast that most people stop using.
