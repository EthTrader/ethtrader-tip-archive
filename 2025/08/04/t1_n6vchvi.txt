The two are very different, that's for sure, but as Ethereum continues to gain more and more use, hopefully the burns can more consistently outpace new issuance for staking, and resulting in longer moments of deflationary supply. 

But for now, both are experiencing pretty low inflation rates with new issuance.

Let's see how this changes in time!
