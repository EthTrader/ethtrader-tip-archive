Totally agree with you in this. We are still early. We must sell when r/CryptoCurrency and r/ethtrader floods with unknown users and all of them are like crazy and FOMOing like in 2021.

Activity is really far away from those times. The hardest part is to remember that kind of things to perfect time the cycles.
