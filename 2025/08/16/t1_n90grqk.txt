> 1. A dedicated "gas token" used purely for transactions, with a more stable price or an elastic supply.

This reminds me a little about how Vechain and Ontology networks operate, they have VeThor and ONG as gas tokens that are issued for staking VET and ONT is my understanding.

Perhaps this could be viable for future L2's, staking/restaking/liquidity of ETH on a certain L2, and receive an issued token in return, which acts as governance and gas fees for that particular network - but I'm not sure it's the best approach - just thinking out loud, I have no dev skills or understanding xD

But, I will be curious to see what discussion takes place, but if you don't get much response here, you could also try in r/ethdev
