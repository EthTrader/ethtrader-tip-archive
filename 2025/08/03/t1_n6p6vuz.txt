>DONUT buybacks

>We're introducing a new section in the monthly reports to reflect the Donut DAO's new treasury strategy.

>This strategy consists of periodically buying back DONUT from the open market to fill our reserves. These Donuts are intended to be reinserted into the ecosystem through Donut Initiatives, grants, and general incentives that support long term growth.

>A buyback table will be included in each report from now on.

Love this one! DONUT DAO is really doing an amazing job towards the project and make it shine more and more every day it passes.

Kudos to all of you that are working on it!
