> I’d love to hear your setup or routine if you’re also doing monthly ETH purchases or saving crypto for your family.

I used to DCA into ETH weekly, and then once every 2 or 3 months, I would transfer out to self custody. That was my way of reducing transaction fees, back when it was expensive.

Rabby wallet is my preferred hot wallet for smaller amounts and for trading etc.
