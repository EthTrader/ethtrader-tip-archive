About once a month the DONUT DAO will airdrop users DONUT, a SocialFi token. There are a limited about of DONUT issued per round, so these airdrop/distributions are calculated based on tips that users give each other.

It's like tokenized karma, or "proof of contribution" - with tips being used to acknowledge and reward informative content, humour and helpfulness.
