Absolutely; I see ETH as a means of generating wealth!


Between staking, liquidity provision and lending, I'm able to make my Ethereum work for me to help generate passive income or wealth over time.

Ultimately, even if ETH doesn't "gain in dollar value" my total portfolio is still going to increase.
