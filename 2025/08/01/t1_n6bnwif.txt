>ETH shows potential downside risk following a rejection from the triangle pattern (Kirtash post)

According to Kirtash’s TA, the indicators are getting worse and weak hands are selling to take profits, putting more pressure on the price.

You could also ask him in his post - he’s likely more technically skilled and might explain it better.
