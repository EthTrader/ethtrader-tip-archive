Yes, this data is over 4 years old... I'm not sure why it's suddenly circulating as if it "just" happened.

It's a fun fact, and it's great ETH has returned to 500B in market cap, but, it's a bit misleading to say "it's" just happened. People forget we were celebrating the 10th birthday for Ethereum a few weeks back... xD
