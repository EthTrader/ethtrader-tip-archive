Yes, I heard that, but if Bybit is eyeing MOON, then why DONUT can't catch the same wave - using the same Reddit platform, same potential.

I’m not exactly sure where we currently stand with listing DONUT on a CEX, but if it happens, it’d be a huge boost.

>Coinbase seems, incredibly low...

The big players (Binance, Bitget...) aren’t letting anyone get near them.
