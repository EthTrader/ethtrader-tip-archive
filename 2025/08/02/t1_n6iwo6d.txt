Yeah, once you have experienced a whole cycle being active you know one thing.

Next winter you will patiently wait and slowly enter. There is plenty of time to put a good chunk of money down there and make an easy 2x and with the bull run not started yet.

Once an investor, always an investor. Milking this knowledge until the day I die.
