I remember another user told me something a few years ago, it was my first cycle, while it was his 3rd. (That lucky duck)

He said, your first cycle, you FOMO and sell too late (or not at all)

Your second cycle, you over-correct and sell too early.

Your 3rd cycle, you finally manage good balance of risk and safety with your choices. xD

Let's see how it goes!
