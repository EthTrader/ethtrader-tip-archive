Different risks for different methods; lending doesn't see as risky as it sounds like - a lot of bad actor lending platforms died last winter. I only trust Aave for lending.

I recommend Evertstake.one or Ether.fi for staking needs, both of these allow staking smaller amounts for those with less than 32 ETH.
