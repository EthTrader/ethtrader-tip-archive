I started using Ethereum back in 2021, initially viewing it purely as an investment opportunity. But over time, especially after joining this community, my interest gets deepened. I began exploring dApps, learned how bridging works and witnessing a decentralized exchange in action for the first time was a truly eye-opening experience.

I havenâ€™t created anything yet.

Looking ahead, I envision Ethereum evolving into a global settlement layer over the next decade - not just powering DeFi but serving as a backbone of the modern financial system and RWAs.

Also, I strongly believe Ethereum will achieve true mass adoption if L2 solutions keep continue to improve scalability.

>Any other thoughts vision/experience 

What began as a simple investment in ETH has evolved into a belief in its potential to become the backbone of the future financial system.

Exciting 10 years ahead!

Ethereum is the future!
