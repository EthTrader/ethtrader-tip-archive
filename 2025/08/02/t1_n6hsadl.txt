A lot of lessons like when to sell, what to hold, etc.

Sold my stocks just before this last crash. 2x from my initial investment in 5 years, I guess thats above average regarding S&P. 

Need the money to afford the kind of flats we want to buy. This way I can hold my crypto with no pressure at all.

This sounds like a win.
