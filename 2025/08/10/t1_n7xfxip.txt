It's funny, higher price, but more deflationary nature, could mean it's marketcap stays somewhat stable... xD



This is just another reason why I personally don't see "the flippening" ever happening, unless you're considering other metrics, like volume, addresses, transactions etc.



But, price and market cap alone?
