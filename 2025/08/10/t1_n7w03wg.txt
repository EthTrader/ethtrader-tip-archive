I still like ETH as a long-term hold and intend on staking now, for steak later as usual.

But these other signs are great, I prefer to trade alts and memecoins for more short term profits, while relying on ETH for my retirement plan, which was more the point of my post. For traders, this next 6 months can make or break depending on strategies and decision making :D
