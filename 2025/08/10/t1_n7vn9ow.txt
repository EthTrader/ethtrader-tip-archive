ETH is demonstrating steady strength and resilience compared to other cryptos. I believe that not just institutions but also individual investors are becoming more aware and starting to recognize the value of investing in ETH for the long-term. 

Another obvious fact that keeps everyone interested is that thereâ€™s still massive room for growth and price appreciation in ETH.

The real exciting times are ahead!
