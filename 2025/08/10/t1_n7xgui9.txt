Another thing people forget to consider is how Ethereum's supply will be as well. It could have periods being deflationary, it have periods of inflation. Depends on amount burned, and amount issued, amount locked away being staked, could all impact price as well as market cap.

These calls for 20k are quite sensationalist, given we've been celebrating every time it's broken though the next $100 milestone... xD
