I wouldn't call it store of value. I would call it protection of your stablecoin.

They are basically buying a ton of ETH to protect stablecoins and the whole ecosystem because they know that having a good chunk of ETH is going to be like having a ton of electricity/gas in an ecosystem where that is the full demand. (I think I explained but not pretty well xD)
