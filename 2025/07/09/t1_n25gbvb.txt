In the beginning...

A few years ago, when Ethereum was still relatively new in the crypto space, a group of Redditors on [r/EthTrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/) had a revolutionary idea. They wanted to take their subreddit, a place for Ethereum fans, traders and builders, and make it something more than just a place to post memes and talk about crypto. They dreamed of a (tokenized) community that could run itself, free from the grip of centralized platforms. That's when DONUT was born, a special little token that started as an experiment called Subreddit Points (later evolved into [Reddit Community Points](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/what-are-reddit-community-points-13e2a839849b)) in 2019. The concept was simple but way ahead of its time: reward people with tokens for posting threads and comments online, and let those tokens give users a say in how the community worked. These Redditors created a social network where the users, not some corporation, called the shots. That's what r/EthTrader was aiming for, and DONUT was the key. DONUT was more than a token, it was a proof of concept. It showed that the blockchain could support a social space where users had real stakes: financial, creative, and even emotional. Users could earn Donuts and then use them to vote on subreddit rules or tip others. It was a living experiment in decentralization. Later on, DONUT evolved. It moved beyond Reddit's walls, becoming an actual ERC-20 token users could trade or transfer. The r/EthTrader community didn't stop there, they created the Donut DAO, a decentralized organization to keep pushing the ecosystem's boundaries. They dreamed of mini-games and apps, new social platforms, and ways to connect DONUT to other communities. What started as a side project became a blueprint for something bigger, a way to combine social networks with the power of the blockchain. Looking back, DONUT was a SocialFi project before SocialFi even existed. It paved the way for today's buzzword-filled world of decentralized social platforms, proving it's possible to reward creativity, share ownership, and build a community. This is the story of a bunch of Redditors who dared to dream and ended up creating a quiet technological revolution.

Donuts are the fuel of the r/EthTrader ecosystem. They let users own a piece of their favorite community and make it their own. DONUT is a SocialFi token that is way more than just internet points. It's a versatile, tradable ERC-20 token that powers a small economy both on and off Reddit.
