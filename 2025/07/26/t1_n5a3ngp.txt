So many reasons to choose self custody over holding on a CEX, but we do need them to on-ramp and off-ramp - and we can atleast have a level in confidence that Coinbase are being held to a higher level of reliability, given they are the chosen custodians for Institutions and ETF's.

Anyone can experience a bank run though.
