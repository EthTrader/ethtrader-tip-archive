Happy birthday to ethereum ðŸ˜Š I first started buying it when it became proof of stake I think reducing the power used to make cryptocurrency work is better to be environmentally friendly

I like how much exciting apps are on and using ethereum and seeing companies buy so much of it now makes me feel good about having bought some already I will buy the nft it might be valuable in 10 more years time thanks for posting it ðŸ˜Š !tip 1
