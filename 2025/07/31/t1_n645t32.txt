Ty Matt for the NFT and for make this contest!

I got into Ethereum around 2018, of course a bit late, on first I was just curious.
Over time, I used it for DeFi and NFTs.

Minting my first NFT and seeing Ethereum switch to proof-of-stake was really big in my eyes.

It’s changed how I think about ownership and security . I’ve even played around with smart contracts and small projects.

Ethereum’s not perfect, but it opened my eyes to what’s possible when tech is open, global, and owned by no one.

Eth is the future!
