Thanks for the heads up on the NFT. Just minted mine.  A lot of of people like to hate on collectibles, especially those of the digital variety, but those people are not me, and 10 years of ETH is worth celebrating.

As much as I’ve used and learned about Ethereum,  the more I realize I’ve only scratched the surface. That’s the cool part.  Ultimately it expands your horizons.

Here’s to another 10 years, 10k price point or not!
