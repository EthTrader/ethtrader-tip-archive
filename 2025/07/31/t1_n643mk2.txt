>When did you start using Ethereum?

I started using it back in May 2021, I remember I was researching about crypto for the first time and I remember setting the wallet in this same community however the claiming fees made decide not to be here at that time. I remember then appearing in OpenSea and creating some NFTs by myself.

>What have you used Ethereum for?

I basically used it for NFTs and Reddit Collectible Avatars.

>What have been some of your highlights?

When I paid insane fees back in 2021 bull run.

>How has your experience changed over the months or years?

Evolved positively, one thing really worried me were the gas fees. Happy to see that upgrades and blob are working as expected making Ethereum network daily usable.

>Have you created/built anything on Ethereum?

Once I created a little app to get some data from Etherscan regarding DONUT wallets. Created NFTs and also Reddit Collectible Avatars.

>How has Ethereum impacted your views on technology/money/ownership?

Smart contracts really changed the future and we are still early in knowing how stablecoins will play out regarding governments, etc. Future looks really great but I fear that govs will try to convert stablecoins into something like CBDCs.

>What do you see for Ethereum in the next 10 years?

Ethereum will be the base of the whole world. Most of the apps will be on top of it, people won't know they are using Ethereum the same way people dont know or think about all the different stuff are using when they just click a send button online.

>Any other thoughts/vision/experiences you wish to share.

Ethereum is so undervalued and its future is VERY promising. Also people make one mistake that is comparing BTC and ETH that are totally different things with totally different goals from my point of view.
