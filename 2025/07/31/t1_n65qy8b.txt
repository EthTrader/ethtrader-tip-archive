I just minted my nft, thanks for the heads up!

I got into crypto because a good friend of mine would not stop telling me about it. He has nothing to do with programming or computer science. So in order to protect him and his investments i started researching myself.  He started on Robinhood with ADA, i think, so you can imagen. Then i started giving him tips on what platform to chose and what coins to buy. Long story short i got pulled in and started buying myself. After research i picked ETH as my favorite and overall i only hold \~5 different coins/cryptos. BTC and ETH being the two with about 90% share of my crypto investments, where ETH has the biggest share overall. I guess i dont need to tell anyone here why.

I was on reddit for quite some time years as a lurker without an account and then with an account before i found this place. I mostly stayed because here i can do fun little python projects and the DEVs for donuts are open, interested and helpful.
