The ETH/DONUT liquidity pool on Sushi is not a 'smart pool' - it is a standard V3 Pool.

I haven't played around with smart pools or Steer myself, so unsure what exactly might have gone on.

It does appear however, your DONUT/ETH position has been withdrawn, DONUT has been swapped to ETH and moved on somewhere.

*help guide me or give me a contact between sushi and steer or how to navigate steer about this liquidity pool being now manage by steer fi which what says on sushi so I know itâ€™s not a Malicious /fraud transaction*

This is Sushi's official discord, and linked is the channel for to open a support ticket [https://discord.com/channels/748031363935895552/1084666830142054452](https://discord.com/channels/748031363935895552/1084666830142054452)

Of course, be very careful of bad actors trying to slide into DM's and what not.
