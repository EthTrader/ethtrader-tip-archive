It took me an hour to find this out, but I get what you mean - it definitely feels like we all need to rethink this tipping habit. Honestly, if you look closely, most users are doing the same thing.

Maybe pinning an example (pic) this would help to set the tone, so everyone follows it and no one feels left out if he's decisive in tips. Though, Iâ€™ve got enough karma already and not actually need it, but tipping just becomes a habit.

Honestly, in a couple of posts, I intentionally tried to ignore some comments but will agree with you that we need to be more decisive.
