Examples such as this;

The parent comment has tipped the OP for their post.

Then the OP has tipped the person who tipped them back

This can be an example of reciprocal tipping, where the OP is tipping back someone because they were tipped in the first place - as a once of sure, no worries, but when these are the comments that get tipped back and forth multiple times within the same post, and multiple times a day - we have to ask is that really what we want to encourage with rewards from the Donut DAO Treasury?
