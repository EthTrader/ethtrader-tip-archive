Ah, my plan was a complete success... cause such a price change that it brings users out of retirement! /s

A 4 year old whale had decided to withdraw their LP from Uniswap, and offload their DONUT. 12.5M DONUT taken out of LP, and about 14M DONUT sold to buy PEPE of all coins.

Trading bots and other users have then traded, either selling out of panic, stop loss or buying the dip.
