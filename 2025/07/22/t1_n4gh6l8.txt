It certainly seems that way. I had a feeling ETH's price was being suppressed earlier in the year when it seemed like a lot of great news had no price traction. Now it's coming to fruition. 

I'm guessing official documentation/policy change will formally give the greenlight for companies to act accordingly... not 100% sure, I'm not American.
