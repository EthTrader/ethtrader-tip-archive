Arbitrum is my preferred Optimistic Rollup.

zkSync is my preferred Zk-Rollup.

Etherfi is currently my most rewarding staking platform, having earned $EIGEN, $ETHFII and $KING tokens in addition to native ETH staking rewards.

I still like Polygon, and continue to stake - their new road map with the Agglayer will hopefully be rewarding for stakers as well with Airdrops, similar to how Cosmos/ATOM operated.

And this $DONUT project is pretty rad. You too can earn $DONUT from contributing to the r/EthTrader community.

Feel free to register your Ethereum address to do so!
