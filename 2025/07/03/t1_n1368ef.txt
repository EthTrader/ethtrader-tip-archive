>Buterin laid out practical “tests” that he said every crypto project should pass. These include   
1) the walk-away test. If the company behind an application disappears, do users keep their assets?  
2) the insider attack test: How much damage can rogue insiders or compromised front-ends cause?  
3) whether it has a trusted computing base: How many lines of code must be trusted to protect users’

How can the average user do any of these tests? Or at least how can we gauge the risks?

For example AAVE. If the website disappears, what happens?
