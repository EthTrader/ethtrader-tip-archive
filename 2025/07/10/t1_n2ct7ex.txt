In a way I agree that BTC and ETH are not direct competitors.. because ETH has utility as a platform which sets it apart. ETH is not just digital gold it is also an infrastructure for a new financial system. EIP-1559 burns and lowers daily issuance so that will create a deflationary edge that could create more demand and increase ETH's value. I also agree with you, the real winner in crypto needs a mainstream use case, which is why I think that is Ethereum. We have DeFi, NFTs, and now RWA tokenization so that makes Ethereum a frontrunner for that role. ETH's adoption is growing very fast and that is why its trajectory is promising, even if it is not a straight line to the moon!!
