If I had to guess, I would say this data only shows users who have been active this round. Until this post, Reddito's last post/comments were back in Round 151.

Otherwise, there would be thousands of usernames to comb through every update - I guess a user with no activity this round isn't going to receive any DONUT to have an adjusted penalty in the first place.
