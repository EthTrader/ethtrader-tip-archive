ETIP 123 does not 'penalize' DONUT used that remains within the eco-system or supports the project; eg, DONUT used to provide liquidity, buy special memberships, will not factor in to an adjusted multiplier. In the future, perhaps there will be auctions, or perhaps a user wishes to purchase some advertising/community event to publicize their own project/app/website - in which case, this DONUT used would also be excluded from an adjusted multiplier.

Dev work of course, directly supports the entire project and is crucial to maintaining operations. Hosting websites, maintaining servers/bots has direct real world costs - we arn't going to have many devs doing work for us if not only are they donating their time, but running at operational costs that exceed what they earn for their expertise.

I understand the thought process, but that logic just would not be feasible or respectful to apply for dev's and the services they provide.
