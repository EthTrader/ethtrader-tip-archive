That can apply for devs.

>Dev work of course, directly supports the entire project and is crucial to maintaining operations. Hosting websites, maintaining servers/bots has direct real world costs.

Again I use the analogy I used with Marc. If this was a newspaper, only the printing press would have real world costs. Content creators like me only **spend their time researching things to give viable & valuable answers** to user questions and/or to contribute to meaningful debate. I often see a comment I like to reply to but invest time to research my answer before I do.

If you have to host a website, your costs are real. If you spend hours researching, you have no costs. I don't think this logic is fair. Work hours are as real as fix costs. 

It wasn't respectful to devalue content contributions, but somehow it was feasible. I have a lot of respect for the work devs do to support this ecosystem & I want their contributions valued. As do I want my contributions valued.

I want dev work to be appreciated. But not at the expense of my work not being appreciated.

To combat low effort & gaming the system we need to use things like word count, fact checking, upvotes or other things I may be missing. If "member sold" = "member is less valuable", then that should apply to everyone & every way of earning.
