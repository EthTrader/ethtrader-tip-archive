1) and 2) Hi, first of all, not my goal to promote my app taking advantage of gov polls, etc. I just believe that it can add value to the community.

Just created the governance because I did not get any response from the modmail I sent twice (if I dont remember wrong), neither an answer in a DM I sent you in Discord a month ago. Yes, the modmail could have been better but definitely not AI generated. Just checked and 25% because some random sentences.

Anyway, I was doubting on creating the poll but I couldnt remember the other tag, type of post we used to propose/discuss this kind of things.

Not my intention to create any kind of harm to the community or take advantage of the gov poll with any kind of double intentions.

3) Regarding the top spot, you can pin and unpin it every time you want so when there are ads to promote you can just pin one and unpin the other every time you need.

Just in case, because I feel it that way (could be just a feeling). If you have any personal issue with me, feel free to DM me and we can talk about things like in the old days. Always open for a good chat.
