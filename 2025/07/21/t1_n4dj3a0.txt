Yes, I am the creator of the app but I am fine for not being used, I created it for fun a month ago.

Anyway, like we used to say "Developed by the community and for the community". I am fine with a Yes, Abstain and a No xD

Its not like I am winning or going to win money with it unless it gets insane numbers of clicks and that wont happen because it is clickable but not that much to reach those levels (there is some sort of Reddit grant)
