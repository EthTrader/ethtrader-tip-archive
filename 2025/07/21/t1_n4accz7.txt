My main problem is the logic that was applied: If you sold your rewards, then your DONUT were earned in bad faith. ETIP 123 does not distinguish between exploitative & collaborative earnings. It punishes those who put effort & earned $5 the same as those who just shared links & earned hundreds. 

It is paradox. We are building a content reward system but don't want creators to use their rewards.

ETIP 123 is wrong. It does not address exploitative behavior. It doesn't distinguish those that exploit from those who do not. And because the rule is wrong, I'm a reluctant towards paying for its implementation.

If we don't want exploitation, we have to prevent exploits from being paid. Telling people after the payment that they can't use their money if they want to keep that income is insane.
