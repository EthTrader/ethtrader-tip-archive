It makes sense to add now, when ETH/BTC ratios are pretty low, and you can stake it. But, I wouldn't be ditching BTC for ETH either.

At the very least if corporations decided to buy 32 ETH, and run their own node, they could make passive gains from a crypto-treasury, but BTC is likely going to play the role of store of value.
