I recall a lot of 5k to 10k predictions. And yes, lots of panic when the winter became evident early 2022 - big market changes that impacted ALL of crypto, like the Terra Luna crash.

 Lot's of hopium when the merge occured, and calls back to 5k, late 2022, hoping it would end the winter, atleast for ETH - but this was probably prematurely ended when FTX crashed... xD

2022 was not a great year!
