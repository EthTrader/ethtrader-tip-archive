I'd be open to trialing the app - but admittedly, as predominately an old.reddit user, I will barely ever see it... xD

*Regarding the tokens or the format of the app to use, it will fall under mod team discretion to make configuration and usability be able to adapt to different scenarios and needs.*

This feels important, as we could still prioritize other advertisers, or simply decide to stop using it if there is negative feedback.
