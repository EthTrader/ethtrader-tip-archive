My simple but effective play - Stake Now, Steak Later!

I'm not a Maxi, I have a good position of BTC and smaller positions in other coins.

I'll be taking profits on alt-coins and other things paired with ETH during this run, but I will continue to hold and stake my ETH for the long term - eventually, start taking profits from the stake rewards too, but maintaining my staked position.
