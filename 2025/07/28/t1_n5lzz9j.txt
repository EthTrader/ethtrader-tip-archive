Yes, that's the main reason why I added that part. Mods will always have the power to use it or not depending on the interests or roadmap of r/ethtrader and DONUT DAO. Its just a tool that can be helpful to promote the community and specific tokens depending the configuration and the specific situation that mods can detect.

For example, if you add 10 ethereum ecosystem tokens and one of them is DONUT, and you see it there with a nice green pump, it can bring awareness + clicking sends you to coingecko page, etc. Lets call it Soft marketing xD

But up to the community to decide about it and also mods. I am fine with a yes, abstain and a no xD
