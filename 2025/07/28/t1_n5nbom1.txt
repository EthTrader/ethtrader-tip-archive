Donuts were supposed to reward content. Now we say *don't use your reward*. I still don't like it. 

The formula gets simpler by multiplying out the 100. My math teacher was always angry with me when results were too long.

`Multiplier = -1.2x + 1.3` 

where `x` is (DONUTs in wallet - DONUTs transferred + DONUTs in LP + DONUTs spent in special memberships)/(earned DONUTs)

Pedantic, I know. I blame it on Dr. Schubert. Thanks for the reminder Reddito.
