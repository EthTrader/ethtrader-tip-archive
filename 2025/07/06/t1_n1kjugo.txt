Bitcoin becoming more stable it seems because of Institutions.  Hasn't been at 80k since April, and has hovered around 100-110k for a couple of months now. Obviously that's a short term time frame, but for now it does appear crabbish.

Unfortunately for ETH, markets still very much tied to Bitcoin movements.
