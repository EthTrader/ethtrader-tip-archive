I still believe there are too many L2's, but the ones that stand out on top, really are doing a great job spreading the load. 

Base and Arbitrum are leading the competition way by a mile.

I'm still hopeful that ZkSync will eventually jump ahead of Optimism - but I wonder how the newer chain Katana will work out.
