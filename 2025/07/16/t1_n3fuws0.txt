I maintain my stance that ZkSync will be a top3 chain, after the Big2 anyway.

MatterLabs have been pretty quiet as of late, so while I hope they are working on things, lack of hype could hurt their on-chain metrics while they continue to develop to eventually becoming a Stage2 Rollup. (They're currently Stage0 which is pretty centralised)

Base and Arb are stage 1.
