It's a good thing. I do think they have a place in the ethereum ecosystem, can't they generate money from stuff like RNDR? Or folding on banana? Seems kind of silly to throw away miners like that, their objectives should be more directional now without wasted computing power.

And ethereum is reliant on Bitcoin, there's a bitcoin bridge and most locked value on ethereum is still from ethereum's presale. Hell every havening cycle you see major changes in ethereum, look at the inflection of ethereum's supply generation last cycle, the merge's ultrasound money properties seem gone now. The slope is the same as before now.

But it's all good, there's not much point to Bitcoin if you're done mining, you can just stake it on ethereum and claim you're using Bitcoin with no impact to the environment. I just don't understand Maxi's infighting.
