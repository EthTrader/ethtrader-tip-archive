>Global demand for dollars is exploding.

I researched yesterday how gradually the dollars role in the world is declining (\~0.5 pp per year) with a focus on its use as National Reserve Currency in foreign countries.

There seems to be a divergence between national trends & everyday people. What you are saying is absolutely correct: People do not trust their local currencies & actually want the dollar. But it also seems that countries don't trust the US & are getting rid of USD.
