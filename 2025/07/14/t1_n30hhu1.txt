I think there will be an alt-season of sorts, but, I also think that anyone hoping for new ATH's on their tokens are sorely miscalculating how much impact the massive token inflation would have. There's also such an abundance of alts and memecoins out there, they won't all have the surge in price.

Either way, it's a risky gamble, but entering alts in the last couple of weeks for a short term plan could still heavily rewarding over the next couple of months.
