Depending on how much ETH you have, sometimes it's a good idea to actually keep some on a couple of different wallets/platforms. That way if 1 thing gets exploited, or 1 wallet gets compromised, you aren't at a total loss.

That said, theres plenty of staking options these days for ETH.

As far as putting on a CEX goes, Coinbase is probably as trustworthy as they come, they are the chosen custodian for Institutions like Blackrock.

You can lend on https://app.aave.com/

You can stake with https://everstake.one/

I also use https://www.ether.fi/app

You'll typically not get much more than 3% from anywhere.

I've never used LIDO myself, and prefer not too as they currently hold the largest marketshare of staked ETH.
