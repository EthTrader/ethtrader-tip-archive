Between the two major conflicts right night, Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Iran - I have no doubt there will be volatile times.

But, ETH didn't even drop to 2.1k from the initial news of US getting involved, so I think overall the crypto markets will be fine - volatile, for a while, before eventually fidning an uptrend again.

But, like with everything, investing is generally a long term play, and it will always add elements of risk if you're investing to make a certain amount within a certain timeframe.
