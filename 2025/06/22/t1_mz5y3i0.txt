Precisely.

I would very much rather see the feed with only half a dozen threads, but with lots of comments and high engagement, than dozens of meaningless link posts with a few generic comments that include tip-upvotes.

I also agree that this is what the Daily is for, and we should always aim to redirect the lower quality threads towards the Daily.
