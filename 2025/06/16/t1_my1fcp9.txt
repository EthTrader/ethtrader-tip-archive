It's mostly due to concentrated liquidity ranges, myself included.

You can choose to provide liquidity at certain ranges only, it's a trick I've done in the past to DCA.

One could for example, provide DONUT only liquidity, and range 100k to 200k. It won't be in range, so you'll currently have no reward, but if/when DONUT moves into that range, your position will start swapping DONUT for ETH, as traders make their moves.
