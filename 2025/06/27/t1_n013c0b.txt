For those that have never played around with a Liquidity Pool or DeFi much in general, the DONUT-ETH pool is a great stepping stone.

For example, one could sell say, $10 worth of DONUT, and then put $10 worth of DONUT and the ETH they just swapped top into a position in the pool.

This means you can start generating fees of ETH and DONUT from token you earned for free in the first place.

Periodically, you can claim your rewards and compound your position by adding the new DONUT/ETH again.

DONUT allows people to experience first hand some of the more advanced side of DeFi, without necessarily having any significant financial risk exposure.
