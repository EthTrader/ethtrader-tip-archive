1) actually u/kirtash93 response is only correct if you tip on chain.

Using the tip bot, the donuts you tip away are deducted from your distribution reward, therefore not factored in to what you have earned. 

Lets say you;

tip 1000 DONUT away,

Received 50 from tips 

and earned only 2000 from post/comments rewards.

your final disitrubition would be 1050. And from that you can trade up to 25% of them without a multiplier adjustment 

Hope that makes sense
