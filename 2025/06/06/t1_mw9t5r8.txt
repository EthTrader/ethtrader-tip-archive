>This level previously triggered a 100% rally in November, indicating strong buying interest. However, if the price falls below $0.30, it risks sliding to $0.25. Positive developments, including a Coinbase listing and Ethena Labs' partnership with Securitize, suggest the price may stabilize or rebound, with $0.25 likely serving as a strong floor based on historical performance.

Everything is currently red, maybe it'll rebound
