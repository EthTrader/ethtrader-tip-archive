Hmm - it appears rccmarketcap is only counting Arb Nova trading volume on DEX.

Not factoring in Kraken, MEXC or Arbitrum One data.

It also appears it is only considering DONUT trading volume on Mainnet, not Arbitrum One

On coingecko I see;

$MOON - $17,790.43

$BRICK - $8,277.62

$DONUT - $7,673.00
