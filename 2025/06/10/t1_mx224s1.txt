Feels like more Buttcoiners are making it to the top position in Reddit management. First they sunset RCPs, now they've banned banners and will soon come for any other vital activity especially by crypto subs that harness features of their platform in ecosystem development.

It's time we accelerate surviving outside Reddit. Have the mod team given Farcaster a thought? I'm not technically inclined but I believe we can thrive there.
