Well, I shouldn't be surprised. Seems like reddit team's ideas are to monitor the subs activities then ban their ideas so they can implement their own version to make money. I used to really like reddit but since the whole RCPs thing then their whole system rework it just doesn't feel the same anymore. Guess it's time to move on.
