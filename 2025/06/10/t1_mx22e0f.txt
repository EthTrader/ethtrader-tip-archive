I believe Reddit is making a mistake while trying to push their ad system.

You probably already know this and I dont know if this helps but I suggest talking to r/cc mods because they are in the same place [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1l6esb6/the\_rcryptocurrency\_moon\_week\_62\_moon\_burn\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1l6esb6/the_rcryptocurrency_moon_week_62_moon_burn_update/)

They are running this gov proposal right now [https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth/proposal/0x283378284935765a8a17f0c62bd24416f01922a7a4744a52f6eacd60c8d24583](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cryptomods.eth/proposal/0x283378284935765a8a17f0c62bd24416f01922a7a4744a52f6eacd60c8d24583)

It looks that could be a way according to what they talked with Reddit admins to still be able to run some sort of "banner" advertisement
