Honestly, I don't like the idea of Reddit thinking advertising banners or a pin post for ads is like a competition for them. Reddit is a big platform with millions users. Most users posting ads on reddit doesn't even know any rcps subreddit. 

Them stopping banners or ads shows they knew rcps might be something big in the future but I don't still think RCPs sub will affect reddit side wide ads in future. Rcps subreddit is just only about crypto and that's that. 

SPEZ ideas is just too confused  honestly
