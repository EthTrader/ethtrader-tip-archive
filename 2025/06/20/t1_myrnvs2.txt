Wow. There's a level of both simplicity and sophistication to these techniques but the dead giveaway was having to download software. If I'm doing an online interview and your platform isn't optimized and requires me to download software then I'll pass. Even if they suggest updating drivers you should find and visit the official site on your own not through given links. You could never be too careful in this day and age.
