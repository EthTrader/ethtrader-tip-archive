Yeh, Moons on Camelot have more trading volume than Moons on Sushi, but that's also due to different networks, One and Nova.

I was one who strongly recommended sticking with Sushi when the option was there, but we will never know how much Camelot would have helped promote our small token xD

Sushi ended up providing Arb and Sushi rewards into the LP for a period of time as well, which was helpful.
