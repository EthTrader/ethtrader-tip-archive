My belief on Ethereum is that it essentially serves as a base fou dation that many projects are building on, many organizations are using and considering using - and all these other tokens and transactions will settle to Ethereum.

To me, it has a bit more of a slow and steady wins the race kind of deal, and in that sense, I'm happy to accumulate when it's below my current cost basis, and I do a combination of staking, to accumulate more passively, and liquidity provision to gain rewards passively, but with more risk.
