Time to pump those numbers. Dont forget that Reddit calculates it like:

>Hey there! The rankings are determined by the number of users who visit a subreddit within the last 3 days.

Meaning that on Mondays taking in count this community activity that significantly drops on Friday, Saturdays and Sundays... that rank drops hard
