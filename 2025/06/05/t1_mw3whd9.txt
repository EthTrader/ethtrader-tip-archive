Gnosis card rings a bell - n/a to my region though.

Theres Coinbase Card, Crypto.com and I also stumbled across this cool concept, Spritz, on r/cryptocurrency

How cool would it be to use DONUT directly to fund a debit card! (assumming we could have some sort of deal, where DONUT spent in this fashion is excluded from the "sellers penalty" - and in return, Spritz buy and burn DONUT to rent our banner on occasion.
