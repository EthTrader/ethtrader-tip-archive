What I like to do is search for 'Ethereum' and then I sort by 'Top'. That is how I look for relevant Ethereum news, I have always done it like this :D. About this post, I think we do not need more posts because then it becomes overwhelming going through each one of them. What we need is more comments and more people actually engaging in the comments, and not looking like bot replies.
