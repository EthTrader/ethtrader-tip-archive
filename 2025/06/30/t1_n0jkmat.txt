They do recommend for my Tools list  but I don't know if they do the same for other lists. You can bet the algorithm will be sloppy in that regard since most users don't have well defined bios like the ones on Tools. 

The best way to search for more accounts is to tap on the three icons on the top right profile page of any good account. You'll see the "view lists" option. It will show you other lists that they're on and the people there. It's hard to find a good list/account that way but you might be lucky some day.
