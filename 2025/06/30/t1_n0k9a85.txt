>But atleast we arn't spamming news links like we used to... 150 posts a day, and over 100 them were uninteresting articles

Absolutely. I'm glad those days are effectively behind us. ðŸ˜‚

>Personally, I like to see more content that actually assists people in making or preserving wealth, which is my most of my content has been about Staking, Airdrops, Liquidity Pools and the one or two safety/security information.

Thank you for all that you do. I hope many others join you in this valuable niche.

>I'd love to see the sub live up to it's name, and see more content of people actually providing trading information and stories, actively using Ethereum and the blockchain, Whether it's ETH, that meme-coin that has become flavour of the month and of course, our community token, $DONUT.

Hopefully soon when the 25% AI proposal kills link posting, forcing link posters to explore that niche ðŸ˜‚
or when we get more users by expanding to other platforms.
