Here is what I think: BTC is becoming more mainstream and the market cap is getting bigger and bigger!! This means it will be less volatile and there will be less space for the price to suddenly grow, so investors will rotate to more volatile options and the obvious second choice is ETH. This price is a blessing and many people will realize this in the near future.
