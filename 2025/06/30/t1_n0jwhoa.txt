Sometimes less is more.

This is how many posts r/Ethereum has had in the last 3 days

But atleast we arn't spamming news links like we used to... 150 posts a day, and over 100 them were uninteresting articles.

Personally, I like to see more content that actually assists people in making or preserving wealth, which is my most of my content has been about Staking, Airdrops, Liquidity Pools and the one or two safety/security information.

I'd love to see the sub live up to it's name, and see more content of people actually providing trading information and stories, actively using Ethereum and the blockchain, Whether it's ETH, that meme-coin that has become flavour of the month and of course, our community token, $DONUT.
