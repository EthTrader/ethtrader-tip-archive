>What I like to do is search for 'Ethereum' and then I sort by 'Top'. That is how I look for relevant Ethereum news, I have always done it like this :D

Good to know. Thanks for sharing.

>I think we do not need more posts because then it becomes overwhelming going through each one of them. 

I'm with you on this. To be specific , we don't need more link posts. I want link posters to transit to making quality text posts even if it's one per week. That counts for something instead of 3 link posts daily. 

>What we need is more comments and more people actually engaging in the comments, and not looking like bot replies.

Absolutely. If the posts are quality enough and engaging we'll see more comments from unregistered users.
