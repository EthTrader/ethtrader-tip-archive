>Are you planing on doing this for the distribution tip board?

Just the weeklies at this stage, 4 weeks at 250each gives 1k DONUT.

But, I could alter this particular raffle to have 4 winners drawn at the end of the month, rather than 1 winner each week. This could actually give all users a a slightly more equalized chance of winning - and WheelofNames does let me take this sort of approach, removing a drawn entry from the wheel.

> Are there still contests going on for this distribution?

A few pending contests: special membership raffle, snapshot predictions and yesterdays minigame. This will leave a couple of hundred DONUT's remaining in the budget I can put up for grabs in the final 2 days.
