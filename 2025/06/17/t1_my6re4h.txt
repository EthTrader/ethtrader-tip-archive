To me, it's a great sign that institutional money is really starting to look at holding crypto, (Be it BTC or ETH) in treasuries, the fact that the markets have held this well during some chaos and uncertainty could be a promising sign of things to come... when the world can sort it's shit out. Institutions buying during price suppression is not uncommon!
