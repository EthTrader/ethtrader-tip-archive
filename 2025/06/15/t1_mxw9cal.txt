I may be wrong but I still think AI hype will soon be down, just like how NFTs hype went downhill. Artificial Intelligence creation is getting out of hand and with the new GOOGLE VEO\[that some predicted might take over actors job, which I don't think gonna happen cause of many reasons\]. 

AI is good tech but I don't think it gonna replace people's job.
