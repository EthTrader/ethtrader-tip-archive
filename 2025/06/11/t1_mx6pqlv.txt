I said it before, but I'll say it again;

one thing i've come to learn from both r/cc and r/ethtrader - mods and devs are resilient and creative!

If DONUT and MOON can survive and thrive after being renounced by Reddit, then it can survive not using a 1072x135 jpeg.

In anycase... Reddit forcing us to grow and expand?? Oh noes! <dramtic fainting gif>
