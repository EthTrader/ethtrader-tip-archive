>If DONUT and MOON can survive and thrive after being renounced by Reddit, then it can survive not using a 1072x135 jpeg.

Exactly this. It is just time to push our great tokens and communities outside Reddit, build a community there and that's it.

A LOT of important tokens have a really small community in Reddit and still they are there so we can do it the other way around.

In fact we already have access to 2,3M Reddit members that are probably on the other networks.
