Thanks for being transparent with us and letting us know about this. However I think this is actually good news at least in the long run, because now Reddit told us what we cannot do with DONUTs, which means we can still have DONUTs on their platform. We as a community just need to adjust accordingly but at least DONUTs can still be used here. The sad part is no more advertising here but I am sure the team and the community will find a great solution.
