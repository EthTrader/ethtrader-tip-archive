Good response.

Staking ETH can yield approximately 3.5% APY, so, that alone can actually help contribute to paying off the loan, especially if the value of ETH increases.

Certainly better than just holding ETH idly - unless you want it ready for quick trading, and the OP has suggested a more long term plan.
