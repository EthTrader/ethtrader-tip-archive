Still not much info related and the Forbes article reads like \*\*\*\*

As far as I read they are talking about something that could be someone in the dark web that has gathered old accounts in one place, etc. Anyway, unique passwords and 2FA is mandatory.

My advice is to use Bitwarden and its autogenerate password for every account. This way you will have 1 pass per account and you wont even know it xD
