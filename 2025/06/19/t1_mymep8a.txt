In an ideal world, we would see ETH have more time in deflationary periods, where ETH burns outweigh the ETH issuance.

The last 30 days for example, has had an inflation rate of 0.71%per annum, which, isn't huge, but is still is inflationary.

As the networks get used more, then hopefully so to the ETH burns increase and we can see periods of time where burns outweigh the issuance.

I believe Ethereum will continue to increase in adoption and use.

Some people have crazy price predictions and hope, like 100k ETH, or 50k ETH, which I think is completely unrealistic, but I do see price growth, and I do see reward in staking to help secure the network as well.
