I want to preface this comment by saying: I have some money in Ethereum. So if what you're saying is true, that would be awesome for me. 

And you know, it very well could be! Crazier things have happened. That said, I have my doubts and I think *everyone* should have their doubts because *no one* knows what the market is going to do. Otherwise, that person would be a trillionaire. 

One thing I want to say is that everyone on the internet is shilling their coin. Etherealize's entire business is built on Ethereum, so of course they will project Ethereum to go through the roof - it's in their best interest. 

I have money in Ethereum because I think it's fun to invest in high-risk assets. Higher risk means higher reward, but doesn't guarantee a higher reward. As much as I will be lambasted for saying this on this reddit thread, Ethereum is a speculative asset, so no one realllllyyyy knows what's going to happen. But that's kinda what makes it fun. I feel like I'm participating in something cool and characteristic of the time. 

Again - I hope you're right. But don't get down on yourself if you're not.

PS - not sure if I can do this anymore because I haven't commented in a while so I don't know if I'm still registered but !tip 1
