It depends on your risk tolerance. I don't have as big of a risk tolerance as a lot of people who regularly invest in crypto, so I personally wouldn't do it. You're basically margin trading, which is super risky in and of itself.

Maybe start with a smaller loan and if eth plunges and you can't handle the consequences, you can learn from that. You never know how you'll react to a bear market with a loan taken out until it happens. If you freak out, you can put yourself in debt. 

Just understand that crypto is a highly risky asset and for that reason, there's *a chance* of a high reward. I'm invested in eth, but I would advise against going as far as taking out a loan for it. 

That's my two cents but remember to DYOR
