I know I've traded DONUT and gained some profits in ETH for doing so, but not to that level of ordering. Ive scraped $20-$50 profit worth here and there - it ain't much, but it adds up.

As for tax, each country has different rules, and I would say slippage rates and transaction fees can be counted as a loss or deduction on any profits.
