Hi! Well you can buy DONUT on Ethereum network with [https://app.uniswap.org/swap?outputCurrency=0xC0F9bD5Fa5698B6505F643900FFA515Ea5dF54A9](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?outputCurrency=0xC0F9bD5Fa5698B6505F643900FFA515Ea5dF54A9) and in Arbitrum one with sushiswap  [https://www.sushi.com/arbitrum/swap?token0=NATIVE&token1=0xF42e2B8bc2aF8B110b65be98dB1321B1ab8D44f5](https://www.sushi.com/arbitrum/swap?token0=NATIVE&token1=0xF42e2B8bc2aF8B110b65be98dB1321B1ab8D44f5)

If I am not wrong you could just do it in one transaction. (Spot)

I see that both also allows you to buy with a limit orders. That is okay, I want to buy DONUT at this price for 20 ETH for example, then it will create and order that it gets filled depending the price etc.

And in Sushiswap you can also DCA.

I hope this helps.
