> so I'd appreciate it if someone here could educate me about it keeping in mind my goal is to not have to make multiple batches of purchases at different prices.

Unfortunately, doing a small regular DCA is the only real way around accumulating a micro-cap token and minimizing the slippage. It's total market cap is 1.7M and the Sushi.com liquidity pool only has about 50k liquidity at this stage, until more users continue to add to it.

But hey, thaty guy who bought a couple million donuts and incurred a 5-6% slippage rate probably didn't care so much when DONUT then went and did +400% the next month. 

That is the risk and reward of a microcap not listed on exchanges I guess.
