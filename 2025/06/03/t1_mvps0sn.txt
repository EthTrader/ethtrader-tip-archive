Hey Marc,

I have a question for the first pool.

If I provided liquidity let's say 10000 donuts and 0.05 ETH.
Now the position is 5000 donuts and 0.1 ETH.

Which amount of donuts would count towards the distribution penalty? If it counts will the ETH be included in the calculation as well?

I would prefer if we check the $dollar amount of the current position and calculate it's current donut value, which then would be added to the penalty computation.

Can we also make sure there is a way to look up the penalty, at best via Redditos page and the dount bot, by also stating the amount of donuts you could sell or would need to buy. 

I assume the penalty is calculated once a distribution during the creation of the official csv?

Would be great if you could answer, thanks.
