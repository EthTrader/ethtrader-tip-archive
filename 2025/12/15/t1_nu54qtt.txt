I still believe activity is rebounding. I mentioned the other day that subreddit activity is directlyt related to price performance. On the day of the 'unexpected' pump we saw a lot more posts, and then when the manipulation kicked in and the dip happened activity dropped again. One question: is there really a need to post this all the time?? It seems repetitive, would it not be better to post it just once a month?
