And I'm just an amatuer. The extent of my chart assessment is a 30 second look-see to see where ETH is for the 24 hour trading range xD

It's all on Arbitrum network, so... I've pretty safe to say that even with 80 trades, it's less than a $1 in gas in total.

Really, I just wanted r/EthTrader to actually have some Eth Trading content - hopefully inspire other users to contribute to the sub with their DeFi experiences and stories
