So you are telling me that I can blame institutions and politicians for coins like harrypotterobamashibainu, fart coin, dogebonk, Pepe, pepe2, peppekiller, poopcoin, bonk, doge, shibainu, ape coin etc didn’t make me rich?

Wow. Institutions are really bad then. They make me poor because the memes don’t pump! 😂

I think when people hear about others that make a lot of money and they dive in head on into memes and rug pulls they suffer all of a sudden when greed turns into fear.

You can easily make 5x in short time. But likely not overnight. And when markets behave like you can overnight that’s when sentiment turns.
