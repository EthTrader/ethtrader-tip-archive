I don’t think leverage with 5x counts as buying the dip. 😅 I’m afraid this will push us further towards $2100 as it’s liquidation season. 🫣

I was hoping we would recover from now on. But it looks like last 2-3 cycles all over. I guess we will see large red candles again soon. 

But oh well… discounts are welcome.
