Just top give some feedback :)

I would have like to participate but the extra struggle to start up my wallet access was to much for me. I Mostly do reddit via mobile, but on mobile I don't have access to my wallets...

Also since the last metamask update I can't send to the dead address because he tells me it's invalid. I could not figure out  what setting to change so metamask let's me send it anyway..
