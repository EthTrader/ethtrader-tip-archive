its allready much more used than Bitcoin. Ethereum network is much more busy than BTC network. there is several reasons to why ETH is undervalued right now.   
For BTC price i think 1 of the reasons its going so high is that its a first mover but when many jumped on board it became super expensive to use. So the sentiment switched into something like. You are a idiot if you use it or spend it. just buy and hoard and hold for 20-30 years.   
now thats quite far from the starting goal, but since miners dont want to vote for scaling to host more transactions per block then it becomes outdated and something you have on display rather than actually have usage. 

i have a feeling we might see ETH rise massively in price within the next 4-10 years. BTC too likely.  
i like BTC, but i feel that somewhere down the road BTC have to scale and develope more agressively if it wants to stay in the game. but who knows?   
  
better safe than sorry and better too early than too late is more the sentiment arround ethereum though.
