Well, 40% would be even better, but, 50% is a good benchmark.

The top wallet currently is 30.29% of the pool.

Let's say they get their wallet compromised, or they decide to pull liquidity on their own accord. That 1 wallet alone reduces the entire eco-systems liquidity by 30% instantly.

This can result in high slippage in trades, and likely massive downward volatility.

Overall, it means a healthier, decentralized liquidity pool that will be more stable, and therefore more appealing for any other exchange that would potentially want to list the token.

Bonus maths. If the 1st wallet was to exit their liquidity, then entire pool's liquidity shrinks and then the 2nd wallet, which currently is 26% of the pool... would control 37% of the liquidity.

This is why decentralization matters.
