That's usually what I do, depends on the quality of response they provide, I tip 5, 10, 50 or 100 to unregistered users. 

You're 100% correct, for someone that maxes, it doesn't make a difference, and even then, if they don't register, it doesn't make a difference.

But, said user might feel more encouraged to register if they see 10, 50 or even 100 DONUT. Keeping in mind a new user is unlikely to be aware that the tip will also generate additional reward.
