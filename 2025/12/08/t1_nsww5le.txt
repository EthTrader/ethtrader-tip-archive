Ive asked myself the same thing....sure seems to be a lot of "stablecoins" coming out. Some pegged to Gold per say, I understand some good use cases. A few pegged to say every country home fiat...again I see some worth to that...but its beginning to feel like Meme Tokens...everyone running out creating one, seems like its just watering down market and folks going to start the same ol story all over again..."Well I saw this funny cartoon ape, seemed like I missing the boat, so I bought these funny cat meme art, even though I didnt really inderstand any of it, and now neither ape or cat are worth nearly anything I paid"
Ok, w stablecoins, at least you should be able to get the value of whatever its tied to....but only suckers believe some scam/scheme/failure is not bound to rear its ugly head.
Watch a anti crypto influencer on youtube...many will point out the rapid development of PCs, cell phones, internet...they were game changers in a decade, our lives completely done over...I cant say thats really happened with Bitcoin and ETH yet...can it...you bet, but we keep wasting time coins that really dont have a solid utility or overstaturated market already.
Believe me I hope Im wrong...I got a lot in crypto, but need to be honest w nyself and what I see.
Thanks for post
