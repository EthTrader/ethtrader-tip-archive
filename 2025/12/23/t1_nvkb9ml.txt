The business cycle, manufacturing index, small cap stocks, and debt cycle are hinting towards a flood of liquidity in 2026. The Kansas Fed's manufacturing index has already ticked up. That's the leading signal for the business cycle PMI.

QT has ended. Rates have been decreasing. The Fed is injecting $60b, with $40b to buy treasuries and $20b from reinvesting MBS. The effects of the Big Beautiful Bill will also have an impact.

I believe 2026 is the peak year.
