The narrative I want to believe in is this is like a pre-bull phase where crypto outperforms equities. As for Ethereum, it is scaling a lot and there are so many institutional inflows nowadays that you simply cannot ignore ETH anymore. Maybe not this year but in 2026 ETH will give outsized gains, patience pays in cycles like this.
