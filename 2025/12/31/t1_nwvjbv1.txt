>What have been your best and worst buys for 2025?

I only bought a few ETH back in January 2025 but then I started saving money for the flat. So thats my worst buy and my best the flat xD

>What have been your best and worst buys in your crypto journey?

Worst, a lot but I will choose KABOSU xD

Best: SHIB because I made a great profit with it but then I would say ETH.
