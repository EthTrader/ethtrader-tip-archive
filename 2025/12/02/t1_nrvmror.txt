Speculative asset remains speculative. 

But, one could argue, even if Ethereum is a "success" and becomes world-wide adopted, what would it's price valuation actually be?

ETH could have trillions of TVL on it's networks, but, if the majority of transactions are actually stablecoins, then the network can still be a successful tool, but Ether doesn't necessarily become a 10k coin either.

Let the "In it for the tech" for the "Investors" go head to head! xD
