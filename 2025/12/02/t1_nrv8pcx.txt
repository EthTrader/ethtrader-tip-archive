I partially agree, ETH has real fundamentals and most people are not aware of it. ETH has a TVL of billions in DeFi protocols generating yield from lending and staking, plus RWA's, plus a big portion of its supply is locked for staking purposes and giving economic security. There is more speculation than real utility for most coins yes, but ETH has utility.
