Idk. We’re still not allowed to talk strategies or tech/on chain data on various crypto subs including this one without getting called ai. 

It’s like all that’s accepted is memes or we’re going to the moon or we gonna dippity dip dip dipping. 

But when you talk real data or onchain stuff we’re called AI and gets downvoted or deleted…. So retail or paper hands are in for a treat I think… I think we’re going much. Much much lower to remove the paperhands. 

It’s like people thinks only dumb humans exist. And if they talk to someone who seems not, it has to be someone using AI. 

This might be why crypto subs are dying. Sure, memes are fun. But if we make a real game plan and it gets deleted or we actually talk genius stuff and met with general stupidity. We’re gonna go somewhere else. 

So imo… we’re far from the bottom. 

But hey. What do I know right? It’s not like I called the bottom at ETH $900 last time right? 😂
