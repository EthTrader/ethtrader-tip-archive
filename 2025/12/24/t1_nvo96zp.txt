I think early last year there were some discussions with Celer for a bridging service, however DONUT was too inflationary at the time and did not meet their criteria.

Currently we have a few means for DONUT burns, coming from Distribution Earning caps, Advertising Campaigns, Special Membership Mints and the literal handful of DONUT from the occasional Minigames, and hopefully we can improve those numbers in time.
