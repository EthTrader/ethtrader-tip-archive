Unfortunately not, the 30 day membership status will be affective as of the most recent mint.

EG. You have 10 days remaining on your membership, you mint a new one, you are now back at 30 days.

For optimal smoothness, it's best to renew memberships the same day as they expire, or a day before if you don't want the very minor inconvenience of losing your flair xD
