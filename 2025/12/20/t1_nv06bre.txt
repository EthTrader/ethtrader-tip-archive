It can go either way, it'll always come down to the spread.

Whether it's high ratio's or low ratios, there will be high burns regardless if 80% of the rewards go to the top 5-6 users.

The high burn rate will keep going so long as so few users are making posts, as the Post Reward allocation is far greater than the comment allocation, which can have more spread in rewards.
