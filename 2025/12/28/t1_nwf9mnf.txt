Yes. I don’t think anyone can say exactly when it will happen that ETH will have a major re evaluation of price. But I think with every miny cycle from now on we might see a higher low. But I think we will see a re evaluation of ETH price when ETH isn’t buyable in as large numbers on CEX anymore. 

We already see a major removal of ETH from CEX supplies. But we’re in a bear market or liquidation season so it doesn’t show on the price yet. 

I totally agree… when it happens it will be quick and those who are not positioned will not catch it.
