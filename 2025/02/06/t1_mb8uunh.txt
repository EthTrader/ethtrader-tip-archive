A handful of peanuts, nice!

Sadly, it seems they did put much more of the allocation towards NFT projects then they did rest of the test-net usage. But, I couldn't explain why any other values are the way they are.

I only interacted minimally with Berachain, never thought a testnet would yield too much, but was hoping for more than 2 whole tokens atleast xD
