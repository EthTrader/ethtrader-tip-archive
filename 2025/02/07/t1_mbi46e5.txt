I get that 5% might still look like a lot, but keep in mind that if a portion of the current supply is allocated to other platforms / communities, the max earnings will naturally decrease. This means the impact will balance out over time.

I also see your point that if more people participated in distributions, we might not need this. But the issue is that farmers will always "win", simply because they post way more than the average member. This change helps address that by significantly reducing the impact of intensive farming.
