\[YES\] As someone that proposed this 1 year ago and received the "this is not r/cc" answer and as the one that started with the last cap in r/cc yes. Also I am one of the directly affected users.

This cap should have been implemented a long time ago for a LOT of reasons like mitigating the race, cheating, reducing stress in the community members and mods in general, making a more decentralized distribution and encouraging more diverse people to participate in the community. This cap has only pros from my point of vie

Happy to see this proposal finally appearing.
