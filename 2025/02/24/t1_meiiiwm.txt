Agree.  Some of the posts recently have seen a high amount of users with less than 1k CONTRIB/DONUT, it's good to actively engage their comments.

u/DrRobbe  is able to highlight users that get tipped and send tips, but it's the non-recorded data that's also relevant. How many sub 20k users don't get tipped in the first place - I'm guessing quite a few.

Only takes a good few bronuts to change that though!
