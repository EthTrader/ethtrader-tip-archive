Excellent point. There will come a time where many more people have 32 ETH as well.

Whether they want to continue to hold and stake it, that's another thing. 

But when ETH was under $100, $500 or even $1000 - (pre PoS days of course), it wouldn't have been overly difficult for a LOT of users to attain 32 ETH.

As time goes on, 32 ETH, even at 2.5k can be attained by many.
