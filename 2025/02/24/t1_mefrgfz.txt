I certianly don't understand the technical side of things enough to be able to say whether it is a great opinion or not - so I'd trust Vitalik, 32 was probably chosen for a reason, and even then, as time progresses, many more people could build up to 32 ETH.

I'll keep staking across various protocols in pooled staking until then!
