Who knows what the future holds, but if you are looking long term, even staking a small amount of ETH can result in some nice rewards down the track.

Thankfully, staking has become much more accessible now for users with smaller balances too.

Even though competitors have outpeformed ETH recently, I still do not see ETH losing it's #2 rank anytime soon, and will likely have a period where it becomes the top performer as money flows in and out of other projects.

Either way; I'm not concerned with short term price changes.
