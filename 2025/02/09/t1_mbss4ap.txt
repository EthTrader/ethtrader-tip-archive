I saw this news yesterday on Twitter and after my research decided to not do it because I think it is fake news. I researched about it and searched about the permissive investment asset classes and list of eligible collective investments, etc [https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/capital\_investment\_entrant\_scheme.html#head3](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/capital_investment_entrant_scheme.html#head3) and didn't found a single refer to crypto or anything related at all. Maybe I am missing something but 99% that this is the classic snow ball effect.
