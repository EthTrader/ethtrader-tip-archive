I get downvoted whenever I say I sold all my ETH at the recent $4,000 price. It took 9 months last time to reach that price again last time, so I have no doubt it will take a few months to go to $4,000 again. That's why I have been buying back, dip after dip. This is r/ethtrader not r/ethbagholder.
