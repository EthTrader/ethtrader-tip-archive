Looks like things are starting to be like before [https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=arb1:0x439ceE4cC4EcBD75DC08D9a17E92bDdCc11CDb8C](https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=arb1:0x439ceE4cC4EcBD75DC08D9a17E92bDdCc11CDb8C) after the services down etc.

I guess that as soon it becomes stable they will create the multisig.

Would be great to have an official input from the mods (maybe I missed it)
