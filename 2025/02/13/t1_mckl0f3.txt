>Crypto Market Impact ETH initially pumped yesterday to touch $2795, boosted by improving risk sentiment from Trump coming out with peacemaker statements again as well as the news of the potential ETH staking ETFs. However, the momentum couldn’t be sustained and ETH fell back to the $2.6k+ range. 

I won’t call anything pump until ETH breaks $3k.
