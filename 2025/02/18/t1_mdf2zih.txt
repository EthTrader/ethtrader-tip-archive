Looks like it is an scam according to token sniffer. I always use if to check a token first [https://tokensniffer.com/token/eth/6qf0vonqxpzqiha2p04jd3xcc10edzsszj9zjuzpo1cvo2x2sd1nqzfzdxss](https://tokensniffer.com/token/eth/6qf0vonqxpzqiha2p04jd3xcc10edzsszj9zjuzpo1cvo2x2sd1nqzfzdxss)

It has this warning
