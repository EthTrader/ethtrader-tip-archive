I am here for the money. Long time ago I realized that changing the world was something that I could never do or see happening. I live my life, the best way I can, taking advantage of the situation and trying to not f\*\*k others. Same happens with decentralization dream, I would love to see it but I will be so cold by then so I will take advantage of whatever to reach my goals.
