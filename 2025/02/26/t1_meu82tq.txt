I get your drift. Sadly, orienting post in that manner gets me punished. I believe the sub now wants text posts to be light discussions, not thorough journalistic epistles that get suspected of being plagiarised at best or AI generated at worst. Maybe next time I'll simply sign up on Binance Square or paragraph.xyz to make such posts and share it here as a link post.
