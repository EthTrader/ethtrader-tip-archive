Sad that community answered me with a "this is not r/cc" 1.3 years ago when I talked about proposing this. Life would have been a lot easier and less competitive xD

In my personal case it comes at the perfect time. Just moved from one team to another at fiatnam to help them push a project forward in time so basically less time for me to spend on Reddit + focusing more on Reddit Collectible Avatars right now.
