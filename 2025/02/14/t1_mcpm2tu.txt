Good news is that we will have a [governance poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ijyprj/governance_poll_proposal_implement_an_earnings/) this round about caping to a max of 42,500 DONUT a single user can earn. I hope the vote if passes comes to play in the current cycle but I dont know if it will. That should make the donut distribution more decentralized and reduce competitiveness
