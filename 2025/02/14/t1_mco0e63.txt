I think the critics is based on because he's a very important in the space but that shouldn't justify the hate tbh. I get human frustrations and him being the face of ETH will get the most out of it. People are just butt pained because Eth hasn't perform well since like few years ago and was waiting for a ath but instead ETH dump. 

They blame Vitalik for ETH but will never blame Trump for his token. This space might be funny sometimes
