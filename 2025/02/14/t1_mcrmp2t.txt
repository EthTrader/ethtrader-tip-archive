adding new members to the org / treasury isn't as simple as inviting someone to a discord group.

it requires extreme trust. so even though it's an option, finding the right people is hard. and honestly, at this time, i don’t see any clear choices who meet the necessary criteria.

i'm personally not a huge fan of dropping the threshold, but it's a more immediate and practical solution to make sure transactions aren’t delayed.
