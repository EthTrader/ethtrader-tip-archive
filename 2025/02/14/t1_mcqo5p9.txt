I remember talking about the cap and got a hard reject from comments like "this is not r/cc" 1.3 years ago. I think a cap only brings good things. Less competence to be on top = less stress on everything and a lot more good things. Regarding the alts, if people want to risk their accounts creating alts, good luck they will end getting caught one way or another.

Currently I am really bullish on DONUT and in the sub because of the recent changes regarding DAO, etc. I think everything is going to get more professional and mature and that is really good.

Happy to see that you are in favor of this change. I am totally in favor being one of the affected ones xD
