The proposal "Establish the Donut DAO org; Decentralize, expand, and secure DONUTâ€™s future beyond r/EthTrader" was supported - so, I'm sure there is plenty of behind the scenes work the proposed co-founders are now organising.

I would guess the next 4 weeks would have quite a few announcements and development in this change going forward.
