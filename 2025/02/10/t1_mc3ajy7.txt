Your moons are on Arbitrum Nova network - and Sushi.com does not allow cross-chain swaps for Nova.

So; either way, it's going to involve a few steps.

The simplest way would be to sell your moons via Sushi.com for ETH

Use https://app.hop.exchange/#/send?sourceNetwork=nova&destNetwork=arbitrum&token=ETH to bridge your ETH from Arbitrum Nova to Arbitrum One

Use Sushi.com to buy DONUT
