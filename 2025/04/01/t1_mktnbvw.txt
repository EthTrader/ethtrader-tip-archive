>no, this is because Ethereum L2s and the way Ethereum is supposed to be is working like a charm + of course price action is helping a bit too.

People saying layer2s is the ones destroying mainnent didn't realize the ETH DEV would have thought about that too before creating the layer2s. And if layer2s gonna destroy mainnent, will they even create layer2s?

I guess it's a WIN and everything is working as planned as most people have adopted the layer2s technology
