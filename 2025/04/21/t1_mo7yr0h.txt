Yesterday I discovered this Reddit app [https://developers.reddit.com/apps/community-home](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/community-home)

I think mods should look into it. I think it is a great app to have a "home" with trend posts, links to specific places, etc. in a visual way. It works for browser and mobile app. I am using it since yesterday in r/KirtVerse if you want to check an example.
