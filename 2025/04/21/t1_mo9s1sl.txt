>Vitalik Buterin is stepping back to focus on research, which is very interesting. I think this is a smart move because L1 has been overlooked for too long and a stronger mainnet could make Ethereum a lot more competitive than it already is.

Bullish. ETH's price should hit 2k soon based on this development.
