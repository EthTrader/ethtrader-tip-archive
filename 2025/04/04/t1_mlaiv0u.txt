We needs MICROSTRATEGY like org to support ETH more. But I understand SAYLOR for choosing BITCOIN over ETH..... Bitcoin has and will always dominate with no competitor and bitcoin doesn't rely on BURN mechanism. Unlike ETH which have other competitors which makes some investors leaving ETH for coins like SOL & ADA. Bitcoin is just too special out of any other crypto out there.

  
But I still believe in ETH though, Eth has blackrock accumulating, so it's a W for ETH
