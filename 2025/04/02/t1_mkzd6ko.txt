>My main concern is that you can build the coolest tech out there, but if you don't know how to market it and build interest you will fail.

You can't just call ETH a failure if you seems to be ETH miner from the early stage. ETH is the future of finance and we all know it. The price might be shitty now but it's not as if this is the first time ETH has decline in price and bounce back. I'm still believing ETH gonna bounce back

>Has the Foundation addressed the token price at all? 

If a coin is decentralized, I don't think foundation have any say on price. If it rises, good and if it doesn't, we all are part of whom is adding to ETH price, not the foundation s fault man
