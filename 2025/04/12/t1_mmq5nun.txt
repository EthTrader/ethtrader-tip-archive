even though we haven’t been super active on reddit lately, we’ve been working daily, getting things done.

personally, i’ve been focused on building the Donut DAO website, which takes up a big chunk of my day.

we also had a meeting this week too.

next on the list is writing the whitepaper. after that, we’ll set up the X page to start building a presence there. i'm more active on X myself, so i’ll likely handle that part.

overall, the team’s been pretty active on discord so that’s definitely a positive.
