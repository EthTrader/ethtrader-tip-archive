> Shout out to Abdeliq and kirtash93 who managed to get at least 2 new users to register in the last two days. (I will try to track this stat in more detail)

I know 2 users registered due to participating in contests this round too; out of curiosity, how would you actually track that? 

New registrations and back-tracking to see if anyone gave them a first tip to register in the first place?
