I get this post makes it look like Ethereum is struggling after PoS. But ETH and BTC arent the same - BTC is your inflation hedge and its supposed to store value. Ethereum is a whole platform for building things and handling payments or any money related thing. Ethereums value isnt about the price its about utility. PoS cut energy use massively and allowed Ethereum to scale even more - !tip 1
