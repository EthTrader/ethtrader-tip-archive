I am 90% sure that a LOT of projects that we consider "legit" are dirty too. Greed is a big human issue and when there are no clear rules, etc. this kind of things are really common.

I hope any of my projects gets affected by this xD

You welcome! Sometimes I wake up generous or maybe it is because I am on vacation for a week xD
