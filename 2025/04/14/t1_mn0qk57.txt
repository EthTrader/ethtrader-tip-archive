>for this round that will see approximately 294k DONUT being burned. That will reduce overall sell pressure and help reduce inflation rates, which make the DONUT tokenomics more favorable for some things like listings and partnerships.

I love this. Can we get the cap reduced to $20k to double or max the benefits for tokenomics?
