True that. 

Personally, Reddit Tokens was my gateway into the world of DeFi, I first started palying around with Liquidity Pools and Swing Trading with my tokens I had earned over time - that way if I "lost" it's only opportunity cost rather than lost capital. 

And hey, swing trading some tokens successfully can then result in more ETH!

Have a DONUT!
