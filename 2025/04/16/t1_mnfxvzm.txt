You never lose DONUT or CONTRIB if you post. You only get DONUT deducted from the DONUT you will earn next cycle. Meaning that if you end with negative DONUT in the end of the cycle you will just get 0 DONUT.

I encourage you to post and engage in the community because ratios are really high and it is quite easy to get some good chunk of DONUT.
