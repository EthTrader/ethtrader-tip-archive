That's the tricky beast that is Impermament Loss

Initial Value: is based on the current price of the initial deposts

Current Value: is based on the current price of the current position 

Impermanent Loss: Is the difference between the value of holding the assets outside the pool and the current value of your liquidity pool holdings

Even though the current value is greater than the initial value, I would have been in a better position by holding them individually rather than in the pool, this is where the $-28 comes in.

If my position was to return to 0.151 ETH and 152416 there would be no impermanent loss, and the overall performance would be the yield gain.
