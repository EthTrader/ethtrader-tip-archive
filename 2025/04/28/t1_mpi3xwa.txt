\> Edit: It has been a while that i argued with a stranger over the internet, still not fun :D

It's helping me get to the correct answer, coz man, this shit is complicated! xD

I can't seem to figure it out; my Imperma Loss is always showing as a negative number (which is normal in most cases, only very rare moments would it be a positive number)

I've thrown in a couple of extra data fields....

so... my Imperma Loss formula was =(B5+D5)-D13 \[ =(Initial ETH Value + Initial DONUT Value) - Current LP Value...

I've switched it to =D13-(B5+D5)
