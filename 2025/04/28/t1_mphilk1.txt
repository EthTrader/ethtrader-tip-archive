Actually I don't get it so the value you state in initial deposit is not the value calculated with the current price? 
It should always be initial crypto times current price, and current value should be current crypto times current price plus rewards and fees with current price.

Hence impermanent loss is the difference between initial and current. Just don't state initial value with the price when you entered.
